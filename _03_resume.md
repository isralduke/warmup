I love to explain. Let me explain. If you will imagine that every search result came with its own instructor, that’s me.

While my jobs titles have incorporated the range of UX Designer, Frontend Developer, Interaction Designer, and Graphic Designer, I am primarily an explainer who designs and builds things alongside developers, or uses design to explain things visually.

These visual explanations are the result of asking a lot questions. I ask questions about the users, the stakeholders, any developers with whom I will be working on the project. By asking questions I will understand the project, I can’t explain it until I understand the world in which the project exists. The result of these inquiries is a sensible and pleasant visual design.
