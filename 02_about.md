<!-- ### During the work day I am an Interaction Designer, a UX Designer, a Graphic Designer, and a Frontend Designer. -->

Somewhere between the pages of comic books and a myriad of album artwork I discovered that design as a pursuit and as a vocation existed. Since early high school I have worked as a designer in some form or other. Whether unfortunate or not, the heavy machinery upon which I painted my first logo no longer exists. A word of advice: before you paint something on a bulldozer, make sure the surface is clean. Paint doesn’t adhere very well to caked-up dirt on flaky paint.

After graduating with a BFA in Graphic Design, I began work as a UI designer and frontend developer at a .NET shop. During this I continued to pursue other design interests and eventually moved on to a hardware prototyping company which also wrote its own software.

Today I am still working in a software environment and I love it. Software is like a purposefully-designed visual image: it is informed by a need and takes a form to fulfill a function. 

I enjoy drawing for fun and drinking lattés.
