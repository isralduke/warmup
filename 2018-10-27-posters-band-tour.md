<p><a href="http://lucyandthegamblers.com/" title="Lucy and the Gamblers" target="_blank">Lucy and the Gamblers is a high energy funk/rock/soul band from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</a> They have a wide variety of influences which include (but are certainly not limited to): Amy Winehouse, Michael Jackson, Sharon Jones, The Motown Record Label, The Heavy, Alabama Shakes, The Meters, and Dr. John.
</p>
<p>I designed several posters for one of their regional tours. The posters took into account their signature sound of a raw, funky, dirty bass and the energetic performances of their singer, for whom the band was named.
</p>
<p>In addition to the posters, I also designed their logo. The inspiration for the logo is based upon the ironwork in the French Quarter of New Orleans, but with a minimalist, honky tonk spin.<br>
