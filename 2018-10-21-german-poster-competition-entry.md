<p>Inspired by explorers who dive to the lower parts of the oceans and inventors who create robots, I created this poster for a local poster competition.
</p>
<p>This design and illustration emphasizes the joy that arises from searching for answers about something you wish to understand. My grandparents have often remarked to me the importance of learning, of reading, of keeping in touch with life around you. My grandmother once told me, “If you want to be relevant to life you have engaged life.”
</p>
<p>The submarine, the vehicle which transports the curious passenger is a happy robot. The happy robot is the mechanism by which a joy-filled drive for exploration will go to understanding. The happy passenger within — by the way, it’s a younger version of me — is entering new realms never seen, is continually amazed by the places his curiosity takes him.
