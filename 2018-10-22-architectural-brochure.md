<p>Former LSU Architecture Professor <a href="https://www.building-ideas.net/people/" target="_blank">David Baird</a> constructed a semester of service learning for his students. He and his students worked with Habitat for Humanity to design and build a home for an economically-challenged family.

<p>I was happy to have been part of a team with another graphic design student, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAxjwd0Brx-B3hgQAX84ZnZZeVo_eHsmMDI/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3BaXHwd0fYRmuZ7aU%2BpbgQxQ%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=wsAYemKOTJmJCQqPgGiq9w%3D%3D" target="_blank">Alise Johnson</a>, to design and produce a six-panel brochure which visually documents their service learning semester. Alise Johnson and I used a plethora of photographs created by the students during the semester in which they designed and constructed the house. These photographs, with many angular lines and geometric facets become the conceptual foundation of this .91m (36in) long fold-out, brochure.
