<p>Natchez, Mississippi, celebrating its tricentennial anniversary, commissioned <a href="http://theslowpolks.com/" target="_blank">The Slow Polks</a> to produce and coordinate celebratory 5k, 1mile, and half marathon footraces.
</p>
<p>Natchez, Mississippi takes its name from an indigenous tribe who called themselves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_people" target="_blank">Natchez</a>. Because the races occurred in the fall I took the wind blown leaves of autumn as my inspiration for the color scheme, applying it to the feathers of the famous runner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)" target="_blank">Mercury</a>, who had wings on his ankles. (I do like looking to <a href="/work-samples/book-cover-zombie-and-human-history" target="_blank">history</a> and <a href="/work-samples/wine-label" target="_blank">mythical</a> sources for inspiration!) These were excellent places to get ideas as the blackberry and paddleboat (symbols of Natchez, MS) are overrepresented. Besides, this was the logo for the city’s <em>fun runs</em>, not the city itself.
