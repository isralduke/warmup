<p><a href="http://theslowpolks.com/" title="The Slow Polks" target="_blank">The Slow Polks are a family-oriented athletics participation group and they participate in many marathons and running events.</a> They wanted to cohesively brand their team, to create a sense of togetherness in addition to what they already have as a tight-knit group. This t-shirt was designed to promote their involvement in the 2015 New York City marathon.
</p>
<p>Not only do The Slow Polks participate in marathons, but they also produce run-related events for other organizations. Look at what they did for the tricentennial of Natchez, MS. They produced the Natchez, MS tricentennial run and the related events, but they passed the baton to me for <a href="/projects/marathon-marketing-collateral">these graphical elements</a>.
