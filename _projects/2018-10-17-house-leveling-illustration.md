<p>A company which elevates houses and levels house foundations needed a series of illustrations to communicate their unique method. As you might imagine, it’s hard to take a photograph of something that’s already underground.
</p>
<p>The house is both elevated and its foundation is leveled, especially important work for homes in the south Louisiana ecosystem. The pylons under the house are parts of a patented system by Davie Shoring, a New Orleans, LA company.
</p>
<p><em>This illustration is part of a series, but out of respect for trade secrets, only the most public illustration is featured.</em>
