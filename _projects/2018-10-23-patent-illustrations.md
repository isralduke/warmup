<p><a href="/projects/st-james-technologies-brand-assets">St James Technologies</a> was a startup which received angel funding to develop several means of modernizing the bulk cargo marine industry. This device, a barge drafter, measured the amount of cargo in a barge by sensing the distance from the top of the water to certain registration points on a barge. This hardware device, for which I did the <a href="/projects/product-concept-illustrations">product concept illustrations</a>, was used by St James Technologies in conjunction with the <a href="/projects/crane-data-system-ui">Crane Data System</a> as parts of their bulk cargo business objectives.
