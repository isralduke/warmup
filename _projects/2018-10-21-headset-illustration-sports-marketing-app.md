<p>Watch any American football game and you'll scout scores of coaches wearing headsets. Whether they are talking about game plays, player performance, or the infographics neatly overlaid atop the playing, they are utilizing these headsets.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/projects/sports-marketing-ipad-apps">iPad app user interface I designed</a> was very similar: it was a way to communicate the plays to get recruits to join a team.
</p>
<p>I designed and executed this illustration completely in Photoshop, using shape layers to get razor sharp shapes which could have deftly-feathered opacity masks. In other places I put dithered gradients in the game to emulate facets of light on less reflective materials, used textures to portray the soft foam earcups and padded headbar, or the patterned section that shows the interior speaker of the earcups.
</p>
<p>My playbook scored a touchdown as the CEO And the CTO were pumped at this illustration. As extra points, the coaches who approved the app remarked on the use of the headset for the icon.
