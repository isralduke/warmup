<p>Crane Data System (CDS) is a .NET application by <a href="/projects/st-james-technologies-brand-assets">St James Technologies</a>, which was marketed and sold by <a href="/projects/crane-data-system-marketing-assets">Harbor Telematics</a>.
</p>
<p>CDS communicates real time and historical data to stakeholders about many aspects of their goods which are transported using mobile harbor cranes during bulk cargo handling. Stakeholders can be either manufacturers shipping their bulk cargo or the shareholders of the bulk cargo handling company. CDS streamlines the efficiency of the bulk cargo handler by offering real-time metrics of the cargo being handled, the cranes performing the work, and even ambient weather conditions which might affect the operations, as well currently loading and unloading progress.
</p>
<p>For the user interface, day and night modes were proposed to accommodate a twenty-four hour work cycle. The final deliverable contained only a single view.
</p>
<p>CDS integrated with a barge drafter tool, <a href="/projects/product-concept-illustrations" target="_blank">a hardware device which measured cargo amounts in barges</a>, for which <a href="/projects/patent-drawings">I illustrated the patent drawings</a>.
