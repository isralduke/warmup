<p>Pinion Courseware is a learning management system designed and built to improve safety compliance in the petrochemical industry among contractors and employees of those contractors.
</p>
<p>A client, usually a large chemical plant or related factory, will contract out many duties and roles to smaller contractors. This client needs to ensure that the contractorâ€™s employees have successfully learned any number of relevant safety guidelines. Pinion Courseware is the learning, testing, and certification platform which the contractors will engage and display in fulfilling such obligations to their client.
</p>
<p>The end users of Pinion Courseware are the field workers, pipe fitters, employed by the contractors. These workers use Pinion Courseware to learn the latest safety training compliance material. This training ends with successfully passing testing which is completed within Pinion Courseware, and transmitted by Pinion Courseware to the relevant record keepers.
</p>
<p>While at Pinion Courseware, I worked as the frontend developer, a graphic designer, and as a UX designer. As the frontend developer I refactored the initial, prototype frontend code into the then-industry-standard Bootstrap 3 framework. As the UX designer I designed user flows for the corporate user designing safety tests and reporting compliance examination results. As a graphic designer, I designed a suite of icons as a SVG sprite.
