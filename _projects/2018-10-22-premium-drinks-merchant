<p>Roux Wine & Spirits is an upscale wine and spirits proprietor that eventually produced its own bespoke wine brand.

<p>These items are a sampling of the collateral and brand assets I designed for their marketing initiatives. These included magazine ads, banner ads, postcards, to name a few. The brand materials are designed by me and I also art directed their photography sessions with area photographers. These coordinated events kept their visual identity cohesive when their preferred photographer was unavailable. Roux Wine & <span class="redactor-invisible-space">Spirits eventually produced its own wine brand, for which <a href="/projects/wine-label" target="_blank">I designed the label</a>.</span>
