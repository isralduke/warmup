<p><strong>St Elizabeth’s Foundation is an adoption agency</strong> for which I did the UX design of their site.
</p>
<p>Beginning with the organization of data in the Content Management System (CMS) control panel, I considered the whole realm of the organization, which included the language used in the CMS control panel. Most users for whom I have designed sites, or user interfaces have not been technically-oriented people, they are oriented around their own industry, and thus the language of that industry.
</p>
<p>St Elizabeth’s, an adoption agency, is an organization which assembles families, and uses language in that mission. Taking cues from their language, I endeavored the <a href="https://medium.com/@isralcduke/empathy-or-control-issues-b36ebc82058f" target="_blank">adapt their terms in the control panel for their website</a>. This language required rewording many terms in the control panel and in-depth training documents. Among their constraints was how roles in the organization affected the presentation of those organizational roles influenced the adoption stories featured on the website. The take home for me was that data should mimic the people for whom it’s being put to use.
