<p>This food distributer wanted a <a href="http://www.lyons-aav.com" target="_blank">website</a> that could be easily managed by their in house I.T. department, to address workflow and turn-around times for content updates. Many content management systems they reviewed had a learning curve which prohibited quick adoption.
</p>
<p>The solution was to adopt a flat file content management, <a href="https://statamic.com" target="_blank">Statamic</a>, which allows the clientâ€™s I.T. department, already comfortable working directly in deep system files, a method to provide the content updates. As content could be updated through Markdown files, they could also easily version control the content using systems already in house.
