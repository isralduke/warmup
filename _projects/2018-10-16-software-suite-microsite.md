<p>An FAQ microsite for a software suite of products for tugboats. A web application product publisher found itself responding via email to a wide range of questions about its product. We developed a microsite dedicated to FAQs, feature explanations, and simple workflows available to users of the suite.
</p>
<p>This microsite was designed for a software product built for tugboats and other river cargo carriers. The software maker spent a lot of time answering questions common to nearly all of its sales calls. The questions were collected as content for the microsite, but organized as areas in the microsite which corresponded to product segments within the app.
</p>
<p>The microsite was delivered to the client as fully-coded HTML and CSS with fully-populated content. The clientâ€™s internal software department integrated these deliverables within the web application so that content could be version controlled and published by simply using their prebuilt workflow to deploy the web application.
