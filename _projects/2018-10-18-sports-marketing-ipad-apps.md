<p>While working for I.T. by Design, I had the opportunity to design the user interfaces and graphic assets of a few sports marketing iOS applications which were developed by Overtime Software.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paul-mainieri/id502532366?mt=8" target="_blank">download this baseball-focused app</a>, this app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/les-miles-method/id444555517?mt=8" target="_blank">this football-focused app</a>. Sadly, one of the apps previewed above is no longer available at the iTunes app store.

<p><em>These sports marketing iOS applications are the product of Overtime Software.</em>
