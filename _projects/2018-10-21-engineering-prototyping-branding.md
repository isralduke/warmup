<p>St James Technologies (SJT) was a startup which received angel investment capital to design, prototype, and manufacture electronic circuits, software, and sensory devices for a number of industries including marine, logistics, health, and petroleum.
</p>
<p>SJT designed and built the <a href="/projects/crane-data-system-ui">Crane Data System</a>, a web application intended to communicate data to stakeholders and clients in the bulk shipping industry. I designed SJT’s minimal set of marketing and identity assets. The bulk of SJT’s branding and visual identity efforts were invested in their marketing arm, Harbor Telematics, to sell the <a href="/projects/crane-data-system-marketing-assets">Crane Data System</a>.
