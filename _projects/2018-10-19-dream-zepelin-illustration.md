<p>This illustration was completed the very same night that Curiosity, the Mars Rover, landed on the lonely red planet in 2012.
</p>
<p>The Red Rocket is impatience. The Blimp, rather old and worn, is the steady, but persistent progress towards a goal. The Red Rocket is sometimes unable to move at the speed which it wishes, for one reason or another. Even when events or occurrences you can’t control come your way, keep moving at whatever speed you can move.
</p>
<p>I drew it as a personal reflection in the moment of great scientific progress.<br>
