<p>This illustration was completed the very same night that Curiosity, the Mars Rover, landed on the lonely red planet in 2012.
</p>
<p>The Red Rocket is impatience. The Blimp, rather old and worn, is the steady, but persistent progress towards a goal. The Red Rocket is sometimes unable to move at the speed which it wishes, for one reason or another. Even when events or occurrences you canâ€™t control come your way, keep moving at whatever speed you can move.
</p>
<p>I drew it as a personal reflection in the moment of great scientific progress.<br>
