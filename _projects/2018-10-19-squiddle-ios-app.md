<p><strong>Squiddle is a free note taking and sketch app on the App Store. It’s meant to be fun and easy for the user without being ugly or sparse.</strong>
</p>
<p>Oh, and it’s available for <strong>free</strong>!</p>
<p>When my project partner Patrick (the iOS developer) and I began talking about Squiddle, we decided that words we’d like to hear the user say about the app are words such as “Easy” and “Fun.” This simple guideline was the primary user experience constraint which informed our decisions. Decisions regarding UI and UX details, and even features in the app, were critiqued along that primary guideline.
</p>
<p>The app has simple drawing tools and a simple interface. The user can choose pen sizes, ink colors, note background colors (inspired by sticky notes) and can import a photo as the background. As I designed the user interface I aspired to follow the inspirations I gained by looking to works by many of the Bauhaus legends and even the great Dieter Rams. Look at the initial hand sketches below. <a href="/contact" title="Tell Isral Duke what you think.">Tell me what you think!</a>
