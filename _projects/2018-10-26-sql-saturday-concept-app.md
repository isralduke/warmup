<p><a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday</a> is an annual technical conference held in various cities around the world. Originally created for DBAs as a way to gather and share their technical expertise, it has since grown to include a diverse array of subjects. 2018 is the tenth anniversary of SQL Saturday so I thought Id design a mobile app using the guidebook data.
</p>
<p>I took design inspiration from the dark theme of Visual Studio 2017, as I myself use it quite a bit in my day job. Further, I constrained myself to layouts easily available to developers in Xamarin. For each of the topic tracks at SQL Saturday, I designed an icon and chose an accent color to contrast again the dark theme. <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/DL0Dk/all/screens/launch/play" target="_blank">Browse the prototype for yourself on Sketch Cloud!</a> Feel free to <a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">tell me what you think</a>.
