<p><strong>Proposed</strong>? Why are you showing this?
</p>
<p>Most projects’ needs are best fulfilled with ideation, and iterative design. Several solutions are created and presented to the client. These solutions are each targeted to certain data uncovered as the problem is researched. A designer may feel led by certain aspects of the problem and the related data from which the designer gains an understanding.
</p>
<p>So, my own solution to the problem and the data is this one. This particular design may not be the one ultimately chosen by the client, but that doesn’t imply that this design was inappropriate to the problem. Good design is informed by data, but a client’s own preferences will be a consideration.
</p>
<p>I am proud of this solution, so I show it here.
