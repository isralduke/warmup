<p>The warrior character has had a long week.
</p>
<p>Look closely and you’ll see his shield is dirty, but not damaged. His body armor is dinged, but his shield is undamaged. Even the sword seems no worse for wear. Maybe it’s a feeling that all of the troubles were directly absorbed, without a confident way to deflect the ravages of the week.

<p>I illustrated this sample comic page and mixed pencil colors, ink, and digital coloring.
