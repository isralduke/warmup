<p>The owners of <a href="/projects/brand-assets-for-roux-wine-and-spirits" target="_blank">Roux Wine & Spirits</a> produced their own wine and commissioned me to design a label. They chose the name Calypso as the sound appealed to them.
</p>
<p>Looking to the anthropological associations for inspiration, I decided to propose an illustration which referenced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calypso_(mythology)" target="_blank">Calypso, the nymph who, in Greek mythology</a>, held Odysseus in thrall for seven years. As the label and name mixed Greek mythology in the 21st century I decided to mix in the look of Roman mosaics. Good wine mixes people, so why not mix all of these elements?
</p>
<p>As much as I am happy with this design’s execution, were I to do this over today, I’d choose a different style for the wine label. I would probably adhere more closely to actual mosaics as found by archaeologists and historians. This would create a better historic look, whereas the current label is a bit more pop culture in essence.
