<p>The age of the frenzied, one-size-fits-all flight and cruises are upon us. In this plethora of travel opportunities, the personal, considered approach is sorely missed. <a href="https://www.rouxluxurytravel.com/" target="_blank">Roux Luxury Travel</a> provides this delightful experience.

<p>The logo combines a heart, a map location marker, and the identity assets suggest a great, wide world of places to see. In some places the logo mark (the portion of the logo comprised of the symbol) sites above a dashed line, with one dashed portion highlighted in red-orange. This suggests that the customer will have personal service and will have things selected just for them. The colors are chosen to say "Professional", "fun", and approachability.
