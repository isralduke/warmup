<p>This low-fidelity web application concept is designed to raise awareness of climate conditions across the planet.
</p>
<p>Rethinking the common layout of the calendar can bring awareness and proper stewardship to something that isn't the property of any one person. To this end I propose a climate calendar which randomly chooses a location for each day for the entirety of each month.
</p>
<p>The app would randomly choose a location for each day of the month, collecting and presenting weather conditions for that day. Selecting previous months would show historic data for each day and its then-linked location. The colors on the numeric representation of the day advise on the relative temperature in that location. Users can also see the average climate data such as carbon levels, humidity, or average rainfall.
</p>
<p><strong>21 April 2018 Update</strong>.

<p>This concept is currently being reworked for a new purpose! It’s being rebooted as a capstone project in a Coursera specialization track taught by the University of California in San Diego’s Design Lab.
