<p>A Dutch play from 1931, <em>Der Andere</em>, has a theme of alienation and suspicion, was originally designed in the Bauhaus style. During the early 20th Century, the Bauhaus were an influential design philosophy whose effects are still felt today, nearly 100 years later in modern design.

<p>I choose to redesign this poster, honoring the original Bauhaus influence, but adding drama, and tension, not inappropriate for our edgy political climates today in 2018.
