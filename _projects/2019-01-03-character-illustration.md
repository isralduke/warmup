<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/a-resounding-yes" target="_blank">A Resounding Yes</a> is a musical project by a friend of mine.
</p>
<p>The band is inspired by the sounds of post-modern English rock such as Joy Division, The Cure, and the lulling, amorphous sounds by shoe gaze legends such as Slow Dive.
</p>
<p>Look beneath the character’s and see that his feet are supported by the giants of his musical inspirations. Look on either side of him and you’ll note that his philosophical pinions are flanked by Aristotle and CS Lewis, whose own critical inquiries are linked to themes in the lyrics in his music. While the accoutrements of the studio and the forms of the instruments are given volume by shadows and hints of light play, the character himself doesn’t have those same volumetric hints, which I decided to do to hint as his still-forming music process and techniques. The final hint at his spirit is seen in the relationship of the character to the triunity of lights above him.
