<p><strong>Illustration is where I began my design journey. </strong>
</p>
<p>Keeping in touch with childhood dreams, icon design is one place where the kindergarten version of myself smiles from the past into my present.
</p>
<p>Many websites are refreshed, sometimes with a whole new design that isn't always mine. A web application may be completely reimagined, without my touch, or a <a href="/projects/sports-marketing-ipad-apps">mobile app may be discontinued</a>. My work as a designer is often ephemeral and that means obsolescence, even at production.
</p>
<p>But, I can still look at many of the accompanying icons that I created in these projects and still feel a sense of satisfaction. Unlike a screenshot, which doesnâ€™t hold the same vibrance without the platform, or even function, icons can live on even when viewed simply as a snapshot.
</p>
<p>Icons are the stable word which remains even when the sentence of the application or website has been struck from the pages of digital existence.
