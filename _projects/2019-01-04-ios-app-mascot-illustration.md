<p>Squiddle is an iOS App for doodling. You can doodle on a blank canvas or atop a photograph in your photo library.
</p>
<p>I created the illustration for the character for the <a title="See more about Squiddle iOS App" href="/digital/squiddle-ios-app">Squiddle iOS App</a> by beginning with a number of fast scribbles, some of which you can see in the gallery here. The developer, Patrick Rills, and I worked with the concept of a happy squid who likes to draw. He canâ€™t make fine-lined drawings because he doesn't have fingers, but his love of doodles keeps him chasing that passion.
</p>
<p>The initial illustration was begin by hand with a real pencil. After beginning some exploration of the vector shapes in PaintCode, we moved it to Affinity Designer with some touchups in PhotoShop.
