<p>These magazine print ads were designed while I was an employee, the Design Specialist, of I.T. by Design.
</p>
<p>I.T. by Design booted up several initiatives to generate more buzz and awareness about its software development services. Some of these initiatives included advertisements in business-to-business oriented, printed, magazines.
</p>
<p>For some ads, I illustrated all of the artwork. For other ads, I heavily processed stock photography to create a unique look for I.T. by Design.
