<p>Working at a former employer, IT by Design, I was eagerly engaged in a commissioned Christmas card for a holiday card to be sent to clients, vendors, and other associates.
</p>
<p>The logo, or parts of the logo, became the mistletoe, the packages under the tree (which is itself a software metaphor), and even the windows of the door. Even the Santa hat is inspired by parts of the logo.
</p>
<p>Look closely at the mistletoe. Notice how it’s made from the parts of the logo. The blue curve shapes become leaves, the orange square dots become the berries. Now look to the door. The windows are inspired by the square dots of the logo. Santa’s hat has those two fuzzy balls in popular representation; here, those are replaced with square dots from the logo. Finally, look at the packages under the tree: they are combined in ways that duplicate the orange dots too.
