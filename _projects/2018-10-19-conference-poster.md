<p>Activate Conference, <a href="http://www.activateconf.com" target="_blank">ActivateConf.com</a>, is an annual web and software technology conference held in south Louisiana. This poster was designed as one of the swag bag items.
</p>
<p>The concept guiding the poster’s design was to use the organization’s logo in a promotional manner. This suggests that the benefit of attending the conference is an elevation of position, improving one’s career position. It keeps the 8 bit motif of the logo while displaying a smooth, effortless transition into a higher altitude through the use of a smooth gradient in the background.
