<p>A safety training company needed to present its thought leadership among its current and prospective clients. In a move designed to elevate above its competition, <a href="http://www.safetyproresources.com/training" target="_blank">SafetyPro Resources</a> opened a window into its internal ideas.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.safetyproresources.com/training" title="SafetyPro Resources website" target="_blank">SafetyPro Resources</a> wrote the content of their safety ebook. From this I designed the cover and interior of the “Getting Started with SMS Policy & Objectives” ebook, offered to its clients as a downloadable PDF. As their market is comprised of businesses such as plants, construction companies, or other such industrial organizations, I designed and laid out this ebook with a simple and precise aesthetic which aligned with their brand.
</p>
<p>The book was produced as a physical book and <a href="https://issuu.com/dukebranding/docs/sms_ebook" target="_blank">an ebook which you can read here</a>.
