<p>Harbor Telematics (HT), the marketing arm for <a href="/projects/st-james-technologies-brand-assets">St James Technologies (SJT)</a>, developed a product to measure a barge’s draft.
</p>
<p>A barge’s draft is an expression of its storage capacity measured by the amount of water it displaces, quantified by the distance from a measuring line to the surface of the water.
</p>
<p><a href="/projects/patent-drawings">Patents which I illustrated</a> covering this system were applied for and granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
