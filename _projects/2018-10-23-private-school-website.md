<p>This private school needed to revamp its website to present a modern, progressive appearance to parents.
</p>
<p>I designed this website from the content first, to the control panel user experience, and then finally to the visuals of the website’s appearance. During the initial discovery I had the great fortune to spend a day with members of the school’s board. This time was fantastic towards discovering their values and internal culture. This shared time gave me the unique insights to create a design which balanced an earnest spirit and diligence, hallmarks of their internal culture.
</p>
<p>Along with the website, I also got to <a href="/logos">redesign their logo</a>.
