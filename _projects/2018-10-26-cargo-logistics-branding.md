<p>Harbor Telematics was the marketing arm for St James Technologies, created to sell the <a href="/projects/crane-data-system-ui">Crane Data System</a>, designed and manufactured by <a href="/projects/st-james-technologies-brand-assets">St James Technologies</a>.
</p>
<p>I designed these marketing assets to be distributed among all of the economic zones wherein the Crane Data System (CDS) was being marketed. The initial market for the CDS was Europe, with efforts primarily being focused upon Germany. Focusing upon Germany meant taking inspiration from the technical manuals and clean lines found in many German institutions such as the <a href="https://www.bahn.com/i/view/index.shtml" target="_blank">Deutsche Bahn</a>.
