<p><strong>Louisiana is the first state to roll out a completed, digital driver’s license in the form of a mobile application. </strong>
</p>
<p>Called “La Wallet,” it is a reference to the French heritage of Louisiana by using the definite article “la” to suggest that this mobile application is the wallet to have. The design of the icon (see the image below) is inspired by the classically-visualized shape of the state of Lousiana, a billfold, and an angle bracket frequently seen in website code.</p>
<p>La Wallet is a product, developed and owned by <a href="http://envoc.com" target="_blank">Envoc.com</a>. While employed with Envoc, I was the UX and UI designer on the app. State legislators, the state police, and other state-level government agencies collaborated on this project.</p>
