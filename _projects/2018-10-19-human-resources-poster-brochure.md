<p>I worked as the outsource contractor for a human-resources company when I designed this human resources-related poster and brochure. The human resources company (HRC) was working with a ship construction company to solve the employee retention problem. Skilled workers — trained at the company’s expense — were leaving to work for the competitors.
</p>
<p>Many outgoing employees reported that they they didn’t know what it took to grow in their area within the company. The didn't know what it would take for them to be promoted, which rank followed above their current pay grade, nor were the upper limits of each career track clearly outlined. The HRC elected to produce a poster and brochure to define the career progression of the workers to whom they targeted the message.
</p>
<p>The design of the poster and brochure took cues from rock wall climbing, a favored extracurricular activity among the construction personnel. The construction personnel climbed the rock walls on their days off and they enjoyed a camaraderie and rivalry around this activity. The image of successful rock climber and the job titles were aligned to articulate the highest job title in the areas which the poster was hung.
