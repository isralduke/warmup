<p>I discovered client needs and goals for their websites, created sitemaps with the client, determined data points for client editing in the CMS-enabled websites, created wireframes to document requirements for inhouse print designers or outsource designers, designed website mockups, wrote frontend code, trained clients and wrote documentation, and reviewed analytics for content and site plans.
