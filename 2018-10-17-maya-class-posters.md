<p>While I was student at LSU for graphic design, I worked for the School of Art as a student worker. This job allowed me to work on a number of interesting projects targeting art and design students. Sometimes class promotional posters were on the dayâ€™s design tasks.
</p>
<p>Maya, a three-dimensional design tool, was being offered to students in the School of Art and the College of Design. This distinction is important to note, because students enrolled in the School of Art and students enrolled in the College of Design will have different work output goals. Those in the College of Design, usually in architecture, would be attracted to Maya for architectural project purposes. Students enrolled in the School of Art would be inclined to produce works related to games or video. Of course, that was a hypothesis-driven design decision, but you can see the results below.
