### These are a sampling of brand identities I have designed.

Logos are pictoral words for their objects.

Logos are not unlike user interfaces or abstract art. A logo is a visual entity which carries meaning, an essence, and a personality. A logo is a conceptual symbol encoded into a body. It occupies height, width, and depth; a logo is a real thing. A logo is the idea made into form.

These logos are a sampling of my favorite logo projects. Some became parts of identities, others existed only on business cards or other collateral. But the logos presented here are those I feel which best represent my thought process when manifesting a logo.
