<h4>Product Information</h4>
<p>Mobile harbor cranes are positioned on barges so they can transfer raw materials from cargo ships to barges. These barges are then pushed up the Mississippi River for further distribution.</p>
<p>Crane Data System (CDS) communicates real time and historical data to stakeholders about many aspects of their goodsâ€™ transit. CDS streamlines the efficiency of the bulk cargo handler by offering real-time metrics of the cargo being handled, the cranes performing the work, and even ambient weather conditions which might affect the operations, as well real-time transfer progress.
</p>
<h4>Environmental Consideration</h4>
<p>For the user interface, day and night modes were designed to accommodate a twenty-four hour work cycle. Crane operators are in the control room around the clock. Night time operators keep their eyes on the crane boom and a bright screen can be a distraction. The work area is well-lit, but removing the bright interface during the evening reduces eye strain.
</p>
<h4>Additional Integrations</h4>
<p>CDS integrated with a Barge Drafter Tool, another hardware device which measured cargo amounts in barges based on how deeply the barge is pressed into the water.
