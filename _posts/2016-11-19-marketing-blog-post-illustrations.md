<h4>Background</h4>
<p>I once worked at STUN! Design, a small, but energetic design agency which cultivates tight relationships with its clients. I was a UX Designer and Frontend Developer. Eager to do more design work and resume my design side (after throwing myself into frontend development), I illustrated a set of blog posts.
