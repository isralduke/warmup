I still like many of the icons I have created thus far. What design projects have you done in the past that you still like to show off today?

While I still like some of the websites that I did in the past, many of then have gone offline or the client has gone out of business. Itâ€™s the same thing for web apps, except that all of them have gone offline and been replaced by newer versions of themselves. Our work is ephemeral and by nature obsolete even at production.

But, I can still look at many of the accompanying icons that I created in these projects and still feel a sense of satisfaction.

What about you? As tech changes and websites, web apps come and go, what do you still like to show to other designers, clients, or employers as an example of your own growth as a designer? Tell me at (https://twitter.com/dukebranding)[@dukebranding].
