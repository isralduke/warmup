The <a href="http://www.daad.org/" target="">Deutscher Akademischer Austasch Dienst (DAAD)(German Academic Exchange Service)</a> held a contest in 2007 in which  entrants submitted poster designs to promote study abroad in Germany for American and Canadian higher education students. 

Having had several German language classes (prompted by reading Wassily Kandinsky’s <span class="bookTitle">Der Blaue Reiter</span> (with great effort)) I was very excited to design a poster that manifested all of the aesthetic euphoria I’d received by learning about the Bauhaus in my graphic design and <span class="notEn">Kunst Geschicten</span> (art history) classes at Louisiana State University.

According to the contest rules, I was able to choose my own title and theme for the poster. I chose “Come to The Land of Ideas” because of the new ways I found to express myself in a new, budding second language, the language of the <a href="http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/index.php?bauhaus-1919-1933-general-idea" target="_blank">Bauhaus School</a> in the early Twentieth Century

I didn’t win the contest, but I did receive an honorable mention. Click the image to be taken to the page announcing the honorable mentions and you’ll find my entry near the bottom of the page.
