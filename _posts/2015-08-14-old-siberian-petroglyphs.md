Some examples of petroglyphs can be found here, in this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=petroglyphs&newwindow=1&espv=2&biw=1330&bih=1055&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CE8Q7AlqFQoTCLTlrreSoscCFcrVgAodB6AM2g" title="Petroglyph images via Google Image Search" target="_blank">Google image search</a>. Surely you’ve seen examples before.

As you read the article, note that the surrounding location has conditions that make it harder for the researchers to figure out the age of these flakes of history. While they can tell that the art was initially “sketched” with stone tools, ascertaining their age will be harder.
