We use images to communicate ideas and knowledge. We’ve used images to communicate records, stories. 

Look at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/12/inside-lascaux-the-versai_n_712645.html" target="_blank">cave paintings of Lascaux, France</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting" target="_blank">Alta Mira, Spain</a> wherein those early people told the stories of their hunts and possibly their social groups’ lives. We used images in the Sumerian Bulla to record business transactions. 

It’s no surprise that we’d use imagery to communicate religious ideas. In fact, religious imagery is a major type of cultural treasure. Think the <a href="http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/parthenon.html" target="_blank">Parthenon</a>, the <a href="http://www.italyguides.it/us/roma/pantheon.htm" target="_blank">Pantheon</a>, the temple<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Angkor_Wat.jpg" target="_blank"> Angkor Wat</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=Michelangelo's+The+Creation+of+Adam+site:.edu&hl=en&lr=&safe=active&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=8_IgTYSJIcLflge--YnSCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CAsQ_AU&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam,"</a>  <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=golden+pavilion+temple&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">The Golden Pavillion of Kyoto</a>, the varied <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=illuminated+manuscript&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">illuminated manuscripts by the monks of pre-Renaissance Europe,</a> and yes, the <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=pyramids+of+giza&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">Pyramids in Egypt</a>. These are religious treasures which represent the finest efforts of their creators, their adherents. 

Whether one considers themselves a member of the respective beliefs to which these items are associated or not, the artistic and construction qualities of these works cannot be debated. These images are themselves sketches of something else, sketches of higher realities as portrayed by human hands. They seek to understand the as-of-yet unseen things in their yearnings of something higher.

But the image above can never be associated with the same system for which Michelangelo painted the <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=sistine+chapel&hl=en&safe=active&prmd=ivnsb&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=GvggTdeEC8Oblgfl0M3HCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CA4Q_AU&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">Sistine Chapel</a>. The image below features religious kitsch. It’s not created with even the faintest hint of care or dedication. Look, even the packaging is hastily assembled. It could only be associated with the temple of quick and dirty materialism, preying upon the sincere-yet-misled. This can not be associated with the previously-mentioned masterpieces.

These thoughts of construction and artistic quality, these thoughts of forms and images descended from higher idea, higher realities, cause me to think about the greatest possible image: the unknown God, referred to by the ancient Athenians referred with their empty, non-image, as described in <a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Act&chapter=17#n36" target="_blank">Acts 17:34</a>. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ultimate-modern-art-installation-an-empty-gallery-421296.html" targte="_blank">(A concept which today is mocked by so-called modern artists, who claim to make art with <i>nothing.</i>)</a>

The penman of the biblical book Hebrews admits to the insufficiencies of their own temples and high priests: "<a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=8#n1" target="_blank">The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was <strong>warned</strong> by God... (Hebrews 8:5)</a>." (On a side note: What a concept, admitting that temples and ceremonies lack the ultimate power needed to transform you!) Just as a photograph of a friend or loved one can never replace the actual person you love, so all of these temples and beautiful art works can never truly get you to the existence within the ultimate reality towards which  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Duerer-Prayer.jpg" target="_blank">Albrecht Dürers hands yearned.</a> And the kitsch, featured above, is most certainly among the best example of religious articles lacking any substantial power.

No one ever imagined, even considered the possibly of singularity, wherein and whatof that the belief, the temple, the images, the words, and the ceremony is all together in one manifestation of matter: a single body.

Yet, God provides a body of work which does, in fact, do just this. This body of work, <a href="http://isralduke.name/art-works-original-artist-draw-illustrator/art-works-subversive/art-works-subversive-bible-irony-way-love-world-crucifixion/" target="_blank">begotten of His own essence</a>, the crowning example of self-portraits by artists the world has ever seen. He puts Himself into humanity and in the same vector by which He did this, created all things in such a state so as to enable us to access His self-portrait, allowing us to understand His essence. If you’ve ever gone to art museum and wondered what the hell the artist was up to, then you understand what God has prevented: the observer’s confusion. <a href="http://isralduke.name/art-works-original-artist-draw-illustrator/art-works-subversive/humanitys-apex-exactly-perfect/" target="_blank">Christ is the exact image, exact representation of God’s essence.</a> He’s the temple and the faith all in one. <a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=1#n5" target="_blank">Christ is the sungularity of existence who can transform us.</a>
