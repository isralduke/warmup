#### About the Client

Recursively Isomorphic is a computer engineering firm which is developing an approach to quantum computing to quickly parse extremely large datasets.

#### Design Inspiration

Isomorphic is term that relates to separate things having a similar form, or similar patterns within them. Recursively Isomorphic feels that complex patterns can be grouped with other complex patterns using quantum computing and they cited M.C. Escher artworks as being an “A ha!” moment for their hardware and algorithm insights. So, looking to Escher’s artworks I created a form inspired by Escher’s own forms.
