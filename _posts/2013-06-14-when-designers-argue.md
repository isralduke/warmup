When you reach out to a professional, a specialist or some discipline or another, you expect them to fully be aware of how to do their job. You also expect that one professional will have a differing opinion to another in that same field.

Graphic designers are any different in this matter. That one designer you love to help you in your projects is going to have a different opinion that another designer about the best way to solve a problem you're having. 

Apple&rsquo;s iPhone icons and user interface a prime example of this fight. Some of Apple&rsquo;s designers wanted everything to look real, like it was inspired by an actual object you could touch. Other Apple designers wanted everything to look futuristic, not constrained by real world objects we currently see. Ask yourself this question: which one helps people, but not just you, use the device? What&rsquo;s best for your clients even if you don&rsquo;t quite like it?

Ultimately, Apple&rsquo;s making decisions that best serve its sales interests in how it&rsquo;s positioned itself as the cool, futuristic company. How have you positioned your mission?
