<p>An annual technical conference got a mobile guidebook app.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday</a> is an annual technical conference held in various cities around the world. Originally created for database administrators as a way to gather and share technical expertise, it has since grown to include a diverse array of subjects. 2018 was the tenth anniversary of SQL Saturday so a mobile app using the guidebook data seemed appropriate.</p>
<h4>Design Considerations</h4>
<p>I took the design inspiration from the dark theme of Visual Studio, as I myself use it quite a bit in my day job. Further, I constrained myself to layouts easily available to developers working in Xamarin. For each of the topic tracks at SQL Saturday, I designed an icon and chose an accent color to contrast against the dark theme. <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/DL0Dk/all/screens/launch/play" target="_blank">You can see a clickable prototype here on Sketch Cloud!</a>.

<h4>Next Design Moves</h4>
<p>I want to add a light theme. In my own experience, a lot of developers I have worked with love dark themes and dark rooms. But as software development is opening up to a bigger array of job roles, quality assurance, designers, and even content writers, lighter themes are beginning to be used more. </p>
