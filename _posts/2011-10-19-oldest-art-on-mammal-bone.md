I firmly believe that ancient man, what some would refer to as the first homo sapiens, was just as intellectually capable as we are today.

Maybe they didn't have the ages of knowledge upon which we stand today. Maybe they didn't have cool phones and electronic pop music. But their art is proof that their minds were just as capable of abstraction and simplicity. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110622-mammoth-bone-oldest-art-americas-science/?source=link_tw20110622oldestartamerica" title="Oldest American Art Found on Mammoth Bone" target="_blank">This article  from National Geographic</a> is beautiful example of ancient humanity’s mind power.

Look at ancient humanity’s art sometime take note of their ability to render their reality as symbols, as caricature, and even as a cartoon.
