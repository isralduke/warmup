#### About the Client

The Slow Polks is a family-owned and operated marathon management agency. They organize, produce, and handle all of the details for any organization which wants to produce a marathon for fund raising or awareness.

#### Design Inspiration

The name, The Slow Polks, is a play on their last name, “Polk.” Given their sense of humor and energetic nature, it was obvious to keep things fresh and lively. The logo needed to be simple enough for small stickers, but feature the entire business name while communicating what they do. A tennis show mid-step was the perfect solution. Their business cards didn’t list titles, only names, to stay in stride with the familial nature of the business. Further, in the business name, “The” matches the typeface of the family memeber’s name on the details side, as if to say they all know each other to be unique team players who bring strengths to help run the family business.
