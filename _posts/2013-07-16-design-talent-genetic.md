title: Talent Requires Work Too

There’s been countless incidents of the “Nature vs Nurture” argument and that same argument has been held within countless topical contexts. There are those who believe that genetics is the biggest influence upon a person and there are those who believe the greatest influence upon a person is rather the environment(s) in which one grows. I want to submit that there’s a third option: <strong>self-nurture</strong>. <!--more-->

Nature may have some influence, but in this arena the victor is one’s own self-nurture. One’s ability in a skill is the result of persistent effort and persistent study when applied to a daily practice. Good design too is the result of work and work.

Let me add to this the countless anecdotes of athletic greats who speak of their own countless hours of practice and pushing themselves to their own limits. This effort is what raises their own “self bar.” Consider those who diligently work at martial arts, those who spend a lot of time in the gym toning their bodies, let’s not omit those who pour themselves into their studies after class, or the investor who is not easily dissuaded by early failures.

Arguably one of the greatest artists in human history, Michaelangelo often said of his own knowledge, “I am still learning.” We can also see, from his tremendous artistic output, that he never stopped applying any of his newly-gained knowledge.  In fact, his work increased his own knowledge and skill, much  like the athletic I mentioned four sentences ago. Further, even  the biblical writer Paul spoke of continued practice leading to better ability, “...those who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour.... (Romans 2:7).”

So, for the graphic designer, the fashion designer, the interior designer, or any other subset of the design discipline (please feel free to amend them in the comments) the practice comes in the form of, at the very least, doing more design work. Free time design work, personal projects, suffering under the business manager at your 9-to-6, collaborating with other creatives in a variety of endeavours, or sketching in your free time at the local coffee shop (you should always support your local entrepreneurs first), good design is something you cultivate with your own effort. In fact, if you think we born “talentless” you can still become a great designer. You’ll just work at it like anyone else who’s committed themselves to being good at what they do.

<em>I admit, I abstracted the Romans citation to cover a broader topic than the original context dictates, but he was still writing about “continued practice” so I don’t think I’ve done anything horrendous. You can see the original context for yourself at <a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Rom&chapter=7#n5">Romans 7</a>.</em>
