Squiddle is a free note taking and sketch app on the App Store. It’s meant to be fun and easy for the user without being sparse.

##The Thinking

“Easy” and “Fun” for the user provided the constraints which guided our decisions about the UI, the UX, and even features in the app.

The app has simple drawing tools and a simple interface. The user can choose pen sizes, ink colors, and note background colors.

We began with simple pencil and paper sketches in a notebook. The hand sketches featured below are limited to features which appear in the App Store version of the app.

##The Development

The development code is created with XCode by <a href="http://www.bigbluefly.com/patrickrills" target="_blank" title="Patrick Rills Website">Patrick Rills, an iOS developer</a> based in Boston. The visual design aspects of the UI and the homescreen icon were executed using PaintCode for the UI and Affinity Designer for the homescreen icon by <a href="https://twitter.com/isralduke" title="Designer Isral C Duke on Twitter" target="_blank">designer Isral C. Duke.</a>

The UI is constrained to minimal elements without being sparse. The geometric and simple UI provides a guiding context for the user and their finger. The homescreen icon is designed using only colors available to the user in the app.
