#### About the Client

Ceritified Home Inspection is a service which inspects houses to give potential buyers the data to make an informed house purchase decision.

#### Design Inspiration

Buying a home can be stressful, so an inspection relieves some of that pressure by providing insight to the places of the home you can’t see. From what you learn, you will decide to go with or forego the purchase. It’s like it’s a black and white decision, yes or no. The business card even has a ruler printed onto the bottom of the card to be both useful and a signal for what the inspector does.
