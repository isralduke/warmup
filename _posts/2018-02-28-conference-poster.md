#### Background and Client

The <a href="https://www.activateconf.com" target="_blank" title="Activate Conference Website">Activate Conference</a> is an annual technical conference which focuses and web and interactive technologies by featuring workshops, speakers, and a hackathon. The workshops are usually oriented around real, hands-on experience with guided mentoring during a project. The speakers are industry professionals who bring years of experience and a valuable project experience. Finally, in the hackathon, participants use real data to build projects on a theme of civic improvement.

#### Attendee Rewards

Attendees to Activate Conference don’t just get invaluable knowledge, education, and professional development. Their admission price includes a bag of giveaways from sponsors and conference promotional material. Among the conference’s own promotional items was this poster, designed to suggest that attendees would travel to high altitudes in their careers.

#### Design Strategy

The rocket subject of the poster is taken from Activate Conference’s own logomark. By setting it among an outer space inspired backdrop, it suggests new discoveries and exploratory experiences. The outer space backdrop also serves as a visual device to bring the rocket forward in the picture place. It does this because it is darker than the dark colors of the Activate Conference logo. The pixelesque nature hints at the display mechanisms of modern electronic devices.
