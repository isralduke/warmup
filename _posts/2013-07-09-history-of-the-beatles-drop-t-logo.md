The Beatles are one of the most famous bands in western music and everyone knows their famous logo, with the &ldquo;droppedT.&rdquo; We learned a few things about this communications asset from the referenced article below.

The first time The Beatles&rsquo; logo was ever painted was when the drummer wanted a special drum kit because he liked the look of the drum kit. The drum store from which Ringo Starr purchased the drum kit designed that iconic logo and then commissioned a sign painter paint the logo on the drum&rsquo;s skin. While the logo went through some slight variations over the years, thicker or thinner typefaces, it remained the same throughout The Beatles&rsquo; illustrious career. <em>It was only trademarked in the 1990&rsquo;s!</em>
