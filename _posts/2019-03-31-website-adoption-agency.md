<h4>Stakeholders, Users, and Persona Considerations</h4>
<p>St Elizabeth’s, an adoption agency, is an organization which assembles families, and uses familial language in that mission, from describing organizational roles, public persona roles. All of the stakeholders and primary users are people-centric and non-technical. The website’s Content Management System’s control needed to offer the primary an easy way to describe and feature new family connections.
</p>
<h4>Empathy in the Control Panel</h4>
<p>Beginning with the organization of data in the Content Management System (CMS) control panel, I considered the whole realm of the organization, which included the language used in the CMS control panel. Most users for whom I have designed sites, or user interfaces have not been technically-oriented people, they are oriented around their own industry, and thus the language of that industry. For non-technical, people-centric users, the control panel would have to be very approachable.
</p>
<p>The fields which they use to create data were labelled in friendly terms using their own language. The help text under the fields offered use-case scaenarios within the helper text. Taking cues from their language, I endeavored to make the website’s control panel <a href="https://medium.com/@isralcduke/empathy-or-control-issues-b36ebc82058f" target="_blank">incorporate their own daily vernacular into the control panel for their website</a>. This language required rewording many terms in the control panel and across in-depth training documents. They wanted to use the control panel to feature certain testimonials but sometimes those testimonials would require that specific other testimonials be excluded from public presentation for legal purposes. The take home for me was that data should mimic the people for whom it’s being put to use and that the user experience should be crafted around their specific needs.
