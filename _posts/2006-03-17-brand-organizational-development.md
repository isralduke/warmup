#### About the Client

Tom Haralson and Associates is an organizational development consultancy which uses human resources and learning theory to create training programs for businesses. Their results stem from their use of personality alignments with educational theory to produce learning materials. Their philosophy holds that leaders should be the first to initiate positive change.

#### Design Inspiration

Their logo mark is inspired by a team of people pulling together, with the leader first in line to do the work. As the name of their business is long, we abbreviated it down to just “THA”. In a fascinating development, we learned that a phonetic sounding of “THA” as “ta” also sounds like a Vietnamese word for “forgiveness.” As their philosophy incorporates human relationships, this revelation made for a nice bit of completion.
