It’s no surprise that people have preferences. This reply to <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=146663" target="_blank">this Advertising Age article</a> is not an explanation of why these preferences exist but an acknowledgement to the fact that preferential forces can be quantified, at least to an extent. While Advertising Age hasn’t said anything new, it’s another support to the fact that there’s patterns to be found in data. Patterns are valuable design tools. Advertising is most effective, or, creating conversions, when the message is nuanced just right for the receptacle.

I’d argue that this Advertising Age article demonstrates the data that it does because brand loyalty is an important factor in the individual, irrespective of political concerns, except in the case of boycotts. It factors into the individual because of self-perception, a kind of corollary to political convictions.

When an organization or company uses their marketing to reach a specific demographic they are said to be “positioning” themselves. Apple, the iPhone maker, positions itself as the fun to use, easy to use, energetic, and most importantly, smart electronics company. Their branding, or, the aggregate visual homily of their imagery is what suggests this. Progressive Auto Insurance positions itself as the easy-to-use, easy-to-understand, modern car insurance company that puts control into your hands. Their commercials with the cute, bubbly brunette holding the laser scanner is what says this.

Now, politicians can also position themselves. Let’s take the 2008 United States presidential election bonanza for example. For better or for worse, whatever you think of them, I’ll briefly mention the positioning of the two big candidates. Barack Obama had positioned himself as the new, the progressive, the modern candidate. John McCain positioned himself as the steady, trustworthy, tried-and-tested candidate. Their logos were manifestations of these brand position decisions. 

<span style="padding:5px;background:#dff9ff;"><em>Note: Now, before I go any further, I am not trying to expose or prove biases in any media sets. Any such suggestions is either purely accidental on my part or an accidental </em><em>eisegesis</em> on the reader’s part.</span>

<a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=146663">Advertising Age says that patterns of consumption have emerged to suggest correlations between commercial brands and political persuasion.</a> I think that the result of these patterns is based upon the viewer’s self-perception. Or, when the positioning from the advertiser is on-target with the audience’s self-perception.

Examining these issues on a quick level, we can see where a person who thinks themselves athletic and outdoorsy would choose a Jeep Wrangler over a Honda Civic, all things being equal. The Jeep Wrangler is positioned as the outdoor, sport vehicle. The sensible, no-frills consumer would more-than-likely purchase the Honda Civic.

From what I’ve said so far, the consumers who view themselves as nature-loving, adventurous, politically dynamic would probably be both Jeep customers and a Barack Obama voter. The customers who saw themselves as cost-counting and steady would probably have voted for John McCain.

Thus the correlations between the top brands and politics as displayed by Advertising Age and have more to do with with the brand positioning of these companies and the self-perception of the consumer irrespective of the politics. There are Republicans and Democrats who see themselves as smart, curious people, which would explain the matching occurrence of the Discovery and History Channels in the red and blue columns. 

Looking at the blue column we find the Craftsman tool brand but we find the Lowe’s brand in the Red column. I won’t begin to suggest a meaning for each of the occurrences, matches or disparities. But it’s interesting that both parties include enough people such that labor and craft are weighty enough to cause these “construction” brands to show up in the top ten spots.

One way or another, it’s certainly possible that in the future, successful candidates might pay attention to the most-purchased brands and how they relate to their potential voters.
