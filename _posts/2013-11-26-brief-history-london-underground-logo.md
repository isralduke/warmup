No, we didn&rsquo;t design it, someone else did.

The London Underground logo is timeless, thanks to a number of things -- social recognition, perceived emotional connections, etc. -- but we like to think it&rsquo;s the simple construction that really imbues it with oomph.

It&rsquo;s a geometric arrangement, a simple ring flanking a simple rectangle, with nicely contrasting typography and colors.

We like to bring geometric order to many of our own brand projects, whenever it&rsquo;s appropriate.
