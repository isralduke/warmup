#### About the Client

Jivka Duke is a classically-trained violinist and violist who has played in South Africa, Bulgaria, Sweden, and other countries. When she isn’t teaching others the joy of string music, she plays weddings, musicals, operas, and theatrical productions. <a href="https://dukestrings.com" title="Duke Strings" target="_blank">You can contact Jivka Duke at Duke Strings</a>. 

#### Design Inspiration

The “J” in her logo is inspired by the tuning handle curves of the violin and viola. Further, the colors of her violin and viola informed the color choices in her logo, deep wooden reds, and sonically-rich ebonies. To set herself apart, she didn’t want to plain or literal image of a violin. The focus is on her as a musician who performs, not on the instrument.
