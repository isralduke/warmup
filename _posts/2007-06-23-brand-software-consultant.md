#### About the Client

I.T. by Design is a .NET, Microsoft Certified, custom software development consultancy. They service many engineering, insurance, and government agencies.

#### Design Inspiration

As I.T. by Design scaled up its operations and talent footprint to meet it client needs, they required a new brand to present themselves in public-facing materials. The owner, a marketer turned software developer, wanted to use his favorite colors, vibrant orange and navy blue, as the brand paletteâ€™s basis. Along with a new logo, new double-sided business cards were designed and an advertising campaign was launched.
