“...but now I have people emailing me eternal curses in Latin.”

Sculptor Mark Porter has created a religiously-inspired statue to sit near a faith monument of the Ten Commandments in Little Rock, Arkansas.

It sounds boring, but not when you consider that Porter’s commission is a three-dimensional rendering of Baphomet, a supposed deity worshipped in the 14th century, the imagery of which is being used to represent Satan in a commission by the Satanic Temple.

Yeah, it’s the statue of the devil that might be going up next to the Ten Commandments in Arkansas. _I told you this wasn’t boring!_

There are two issues here that I want to talk about. I want to talk about the art itself and the political aspect.

###The Art Itself

<a href="http://observer.com/2015/08/the-satanic-sculptor-a-chat-with-americas-most-controversial-artist/" target="_blank" title="Article about Mark Porter, the scupltor of the Baphoment Statue">The article in Observer does credit to the amount of effort and research that Mr Porter had to do.</a> Porter also recounts his own influences from music he liked in his adolescence. _Cue the metal heads’ dancing!_

Based upon photos I’ve seen, Porter’s work is **masterfully** executed. 

One point of his execution is the amount of research he’s done to fulfill his work. From looking to Caravaggio to the Arts & Craft movement for extra ideas, he’s had to provide more substance than was present in the original drawing (referenced in the source article). Porter’s looked to many other sources for more visual information to substitute for what he couldn’t get from the original inspiration.

Surely the saying “Good artists borrow, great artists steal” will come to mind: Mr Porter’s work is excellent. I hope that no one, seeing his laborious devotion to this work, would doubt that his work has a place in history.

###The Political Aspect

But that’s not all I can think about right now, and that’s why I am writing this. Now there’s the issue of religious favoritism and zealotry. You see, in a land of free people, when we allow one group to make a strong statement, we must allow for another to also make a strong statement.

The Temple of Satan has a legal right to make a statue that represents their beliefs for public installation just as the Ten Commandments group does.

But there is a difference between the two installations. While both are testaments to a belief system and shouldn’t be politically enforced or prohibited, there is a nuanced difference between these two installations that should be noted.

One of the installations is a representation of a being, a personality, the so-called “devil statue.” The central concept is a persona. The other is a collection of laws, which inherently celebrates the rule of law in as central concept, inclusive of all people.

Rule of law doesn’t celebrate a specific personality, as it exists to serve and protect all persons living within it.

Personally, as a Libertarian, I support the freedom of any belief system’s adherents to vocalize their own thoughts, and even to do so in public space, Satanists, Christians, and any of the many other systems.

While the chimeric statue is wonderfully sculpted, I think an installation of their legal foundations, or those rules by which the Satanic Temple lives would have been more appropriate to sit next to the Ten Commandments. Such an installation would have invited dialogue around the comparison and contrasts between legal philosophies. Not only would this would be a better artistic representation for a free society, it would be more appropriate for a statehouse. Instead, it feels that the intent is to mock our shared society’s foundational support in the rule of law rather than invite conversation or a true comparison of belief systems.
