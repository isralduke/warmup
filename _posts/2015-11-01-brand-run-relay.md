#### About the Client

Run My Relay is a public relations agency which runs media and public relations campaigns for athletic events.

#### Design Inspiration

The logo is inspired by hashtags and by relay runners handing off the baton. The hands are passing the baton, throwing encouraging victory wishes as they cross a finish line. The hands, baton, and finish line all form a kind of a hashtag shape. The #hashtags in front of “myrelay” is a remnder that their clients’ campaigns are in winning hands.
