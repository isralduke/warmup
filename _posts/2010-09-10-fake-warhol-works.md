big_image_alt: Warhol Works Found to be Fake
---
So, <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/28772/20100904/" target="_blank">the Warhol Brillo Boxes at Stockholm’s Moderna Museet have been confirmed to be fake</a>, as of the date of this posting anyway. I truly feel sorry for this museum. Unfortunately, modern art museums are not immune to being victimized by art charlatans. One of the risks of experimentation and exploring the <em>avant-garde</em> is that unscrupulous visual hucksters find them easy targets. 

I’m surprised that I don’t know what I think about this. You see, Warhol himself was simply copying others’ works. He sloppily, half-heartedly, used his “mass production” factory as an excuse for cheap knockoff work. Then, he took the position of irony and satire from which to attack the mindset of his time. We all know from literature, that satire is <strong>not</strong> what it describes. Thus, a satirical thing is a fake of that which it mocks.

In conclusion, these fakes may be actual fakes, but according to the rules by which Warhol played, they are then “real” in his own context from which he safely hid from the “real” items about which he visually jested.

You see, irony is double-faced. In fact, irony’s true nature is that of two mirrors pointed at each other.
