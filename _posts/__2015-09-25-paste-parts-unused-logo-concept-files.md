Every designer has done logo projects for a few clients. The situation is like this: the client saw a few concepts, chose one, and the other logo options went back into the designers harddrive, probably never to see the light of day again. The same thing has happened to me. 

I don&rsquo;t want all of those other projects to remain hidden, never to be used again.

I&rsquo;m selling the unused logo concepts for other designers to get inspiration for their own logo projects. The package has a Sketch.app file of all of the logos, PDFs of the logos, and SVGs of the logos, ready to be used in any vector graphics app. Buyers will get free updates as I add new logos. The buyer will also get any new ones as I continually add more.
