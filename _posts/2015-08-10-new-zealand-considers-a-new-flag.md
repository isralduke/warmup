New Zealand was once a British territory, so a flag bearing symbols of the Union Jack was an appropriate national mark. Yet, given that <a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/self-government-and-independence" target="_blank" title=
"Brief History of New Zealand">New Zealand is an independent nation</a> (since 1986), are the marks borrowed from British symbols appropriate?

Apparently the current government doesn't think so. As stated at The Verge:

> Prime Minister John Key saying it was time for New Zealand to discard its current design in favor of one “that better reflects our status as a modern, independent nation.”

I have selected some of my favorite designs among those featured by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9125785/new-zealand-new-flag-design-referendum" target="_blank" title="Source article at The Verge">The Verge.</a>
