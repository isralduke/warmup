When we look at art we often don't have the luxury of having the artist with us to explain the work which we see. The only clues that we are given are those within the visual composition of the work. 

Sometimes that title tells us what the composition is about, sometimes it doesn't. So, for this review, I am going on what I can see of the painting and the title. If I am mistaken in any thing, I would certainly welcome correction by the artist, <a href="http://www.brettkaufman.com/art.html" target="_blank">S. Brett Kaufman</a>.

Golda Meir was the first female Prime Minister of Israel, the third woman in the world to hold such a position. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir" target="_blank">You can read more about her at this Wikipedia entry.</a> Kaufman's sentiment of Golda Meir is evident  by his treatment of her portrait. 

Her facial features are spreading across a land which flourishes more as the greenery spreads from right to left, during which the land becomes more fruitful. We can read this movement as progress as the Hebrew alphabet is written and read from right to left, thus the inherent interpretation of such a direction by a person literate in Hebrew would be to read this as growth, progress.

Meir’s face has a kind, modest smile, a fitting expression for a woman who came to be known as the "... grandmother of the Jewish people" (see Wikipedia link above).
