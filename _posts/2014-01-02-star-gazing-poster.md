This poster, one of several designed for an educational setting, is inspired by literary giant Oscar Wilde. Wilde is well-known for his enthusiasm for life, so we thought to incorporate him into the collection of quotes to display to learners.

The figure near the bottom of the poster has a single giant eye, with a star&rsquo;s reflection illuminating the eye. The figure&rsquo;s entire body is stretched upward in joy at the night sky, at the light trickling down. The text is arranged to suggest a path of learning: reception of knowledge, processing that knowledge, and then ascension.

<blockquote>
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. 
&mdash; Oscar Wilde
