Most people use the weekend to get away from work, but our Director, Isral Duke, recently used one weekend to work <strong>even more</strong> than normal!

<a href="http://startupweekend.org" title="Startup Weekend" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> is a gathering of curious, motivated people who are just as much inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit as creatives are the creative spirit. Isral Duke recently participated in a Baton rouge, LA instance in August 2013. His alma mater, <a href="http://www.lsu.edu/departments/gold/2013/09/startup.shtml" title="LSU Media Article covering August 2013 Startup Weekend" target="_blank">Louisiana State University, recently featured an article covering the event</a>.

<blockquote>What a way to spend a weekend: Rapid-fire brainstorm sessions; focused research efforts; and learning, learning, learning as members of teams brought together just hours before from among a group of strangers &mdash; all of whom arrived hoping to launch their own businesses &mdash; develop six focused ideas into viable startup companies.</blockquote>
