No one would deny that Leonardo da Vinci was a very accomplished person. He has a long string of achievements to his credit.

He was a painter &mdash; most people know his Mona Lisa &mdash; he was also a sculptor, and an inventor. One would only have to peruse the pages of his notebooks to see a glimpse of his many talents.

It seems he also invented musical instruments. The video below will allow you to hear music played on an instrument that he designed. It&rsquo;s called <em>viola organista</em>, built only recently by a Polish pianist and instrument maker.
