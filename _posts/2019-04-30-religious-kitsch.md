#### Historic References

Look at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/12/inside-lascaux-the-versai_n_712645.html" target="_blank">cave paintings of Lascaux, France</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting" target="_blank">Alta Mira, Spain</a> wherein those early people told the stories of their hunts and possibly their social groups’ lives. We used images in the Sumerian Bulla to record business transactions. 

It’s no surprise that we use imagery to communicate religious ideas. In fact, religious imagery is a major type of cultural treasure. Think about the <a href="http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/parthenon.html" target="_blank">Parthenon</a>, the <a href="http://www.italyguides.it/us/roma/pantheon.htm" target="_blank">Pantheon</a>, the temple<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Angkor_Wat.jpg" target="_blank"> Angkor Wat</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=Michelangelo's+The+Creation+of+Adam+site:.edu&hl=en&lr=&safe=active&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=8_IgTYSJIcLflge--YnSCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CAsQ_AU&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">Michelangelo’s "The Creation of Adam,"</a>  <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=golden+pavilion+temple&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">The Golden Pavillion of Kyoto</a>, the varied <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=illuminated+manuscript&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">illuminated manuscripts by the monks of pre-Renaissance Europe,</a> and yes, the <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=pyramids+of+giza&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">Pyramids in Egypt</a>. And, lately we’ve seen the frenetic pace of first responders’ actions in saving the art treasures in the 2019 fire at Notre Dame in Paris. These are all religious treasures which represent the finest efforts of their creators and their adherents. 

#### Connected or Disconnected?

Whether one considers themselves a member of the respective beliefs to which these items are associated or not, the artistic and construction qualities of these works can’t be debated. These images are themselves sketches of something else, sketches of higher realities as portrayed by human hands from some idea gotten by the heads which control the hands. They seek to understand the as-of-yet unseen things in their yearnings of something higher.

The featured image above can never be associated with the same system for which Michelangelo painted the <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=sistine+chapel&hl=en&safe=active&prmd=ivnsb&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=GvggTdeEC8Oblgfl0M3HCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CA4Q_AU&biw=1046&bih=1234" target="_blank">Sistine Chapel</a>. The featured image is religious kitsch. It’s not created with even the faintest hint of care or dedication. Look, even the packaging is hastily assembled. It will forever only be associated with the temple of quick and dirty materialism, preying upon the _(hopefully)_ sincere-yet-misled. This can not be associated with the previously-mentioned masterpieces.

#### Shadows &amp; Beacons

The subjects construction and artistic quality, the matter of forms and images descended from higher ideas, higher realities, make me to think about the greatest possible image: the unknown God, referred to by the ancient Athenians referred with their empty, non-image, as described in <a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Act&chapter=17#n36" target="_blank">Acts 17:34</a>. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ultimate-modern-art-installation-an-empty-gallery-421296.html" targte="_blank">(A concept is mocked today by those who claim to make art with <i>nothing.</i>)</a> Those ancient Athenians kept a placeholder in their thinking for the unknown. They intentionally made space for what they didn’t know. _(By the way, <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Athenian_Democracy/" title="Athens is the birthplace of democracy" target="_blank">Athens is where democracy popped up</a>.)_

#### Insufficient Knowledge

I think the Athenians did a wonderful thing by admitting to something they didn’t yet know. As a cosmopolitan town, a thinking place, they dared not imagine themselves the apex of civilization. They clearly were aware that they didn’t know some things about the world, even if they were playing it safe with a fail safe approach to being culturally thorough.

To continue along this idea, let me mention the penman of Hebrews, the biblical book. Paul _(many think he penned this book)_ admits to the insufficiencies of his own faith’s temples and high priests: "<a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=8#n1" target="_blank">The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was <strong>warned</strong> by God... (Hebrews 8:5)</a>." 

Just as a photograph of a friend or loved one can never replace the actual person you love, so all of these temples and beautiful art works can never truly transform you to the existence within the ultimate reality towards which  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Duerer-Prayer.jpg" target="_blank" title="Albrecht Durer, Praying Hands.">Albrecht Dürers hands yearned.</a> 

#### The Best Image is Enduring Reality

I am not aware of any existing claim that belief, temple, sacred words, ceremony, or image are all be embodied in a single form, a person before Jesus claimed it in John 8:58 &sup1;, “Before Abraham, I AM.” Unlike the Athenians, clever as they were, Jesus left no room for that specific unknown. 

To Paul’s sufficient, and specific knowledge, which he shared with the Athenians Jesus is the exact image of the Father’s own essence. Jesus is the crowning instance of a class of artwork, self-portraits by artists themselves. God put Himself into humanity and in the same moment in which He did this, created all things in such a state so as to enable us to access His self-portrait, allowing us to understand His essence. 

If you’ve ever gone to an art museum, looked at a puzzling work of art, and wondered what the hell the artist was up to, then you know what God has prevented: the observer’s ignorance. <a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=1#n5" target="_blank" title="Bible verse for Jesus Christ being the Image of God.">Jesus Christ is the exact image, exact representation of God’s essence.</a> He’s the temple and the faith all in one. Christ is the singularity of existence who can transform us.

###### Notes

&sup1; Jesus claimed to be one with The Father. Several times He made this claim, and each time He met with vicious religious friction.
