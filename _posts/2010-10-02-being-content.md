<blockquote>“<em>What you don’t have / You don’t need it now / You don’t need it now</em>”
U2, "Beautiful Day"</blockquote>
<em>This is a reprint from an article written in November 2007 for a discussion group.</em>

Being content is a sign that you trust in God. Being content is a sign of trust in God because you realize, better still, you live in the knowledge of God’s provision for your needs <em>(Genesis 22:14).</em> We know from Jesus’ own lessons that God will care for us and see to it that our basic needs, and sometimes our wants <em>(Psalm 37:4),</em> aren’t unmet.

We have a lot of reasons to be anxious: Will I pass that test? Will my professor give me a bad grade on the drawing? Are my parents going to work this out? Will she/he like me? These are not bad things for our attention, true, because then we can take them to God in prayer <em>(1 Peter 5:7).</em> Yet, insisting on dwelling upon them to the point of worry is like yanking them from God’s hands and pulling them to yourself, when you can’t even make your own hair gray <em>(Matthew 5:36).</em> The world leaves all kinds of other reasons at the doors of our hearts to be anxious: Ooh, look at that car! Hm, all these new albums are being released! Man, I want a new laptop!

When we aren’t content with God’s provision for the basics <em>(1 Timothy 6:8),</em> we actually open the doors for envy and materialism, an incessant spiral into unending cravings for things that do not fill us. In his book <em>The Screwtape Letters,</em> C.S. Lewis, through the mouth of Screwtape, explained addiction: an addiction is anything for which there is an increasing need and a diminishing pleasure. Not being content, then, is a kind of spiritual equivalent to chemical dependency. Thus, it is important to be content.

How then, should we now live in contentment? This is something I ask of myself right now. Honestly, contentment is something I am working on too. It was my prayer request for last week. Here is where I have begun my thoughts: maybe you can’t be content until you’re thankful. What reasons have I to be thankful? Thankfulness establishing in your own minds the things which God has already done in your own lives. Knowing the things which God has already done in your lives establishes a basis for knowledge that He will continue to provide. This is the first reason to thank God.

<blockquote>“I am not saying this because I am need, for I have learned to be content in whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and i know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.” <em>Philippians 4:11–12.</em>

“…Godliness with contentment is great gain.” <em>1 Timothy 6:6</em>

“Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.” <em>1 Corinthians 7:17</em>

“Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great wealth with turmoil.” <em>Proverbs 15:16</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>“Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’ ” <em>Hebrews 13:5</em></blockquote>
