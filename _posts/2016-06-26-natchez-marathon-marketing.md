#### Background

Natchez, Mississippi celebrated its tricentennial birthday with several days of <a href="https://thenatchezhalf.itsyourrace.com/event.aspx?id=7774" title="Race Listing for The Natchez Half" target="_blank">marathons and fun runs in November 2016</a>. The Natchez marathons were produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/theslowpolks" title="The Slow Polks" tarhet="_blank">The Slow Polks, a marathon production agency</a>.

#### Design Considerations

I began with a logo design. The logo is inspired by the colors of fall and water, by wing feathers to symbolize the runners, and each of the three feathers symbolizes one-hundred years. The typeface was chosen because it evoked a classical, refined mood.

#### Design Delivarables

The marathon and fun run days required an assortment of visual collateral in celebration of the city’s birthday. I provided design files which were produced by several print vendors.

Design assets included:

- Logo.
- Runners’ Bibs. These display race information and the runner’s number.
- Directional Signs. Guiding runners and observers along the path of the race and any foks in the route.
- Historic Markers. Runners and observers can learn about historic points along the race route.
- Social Graphics for social media promotion.
- Race Medals. Custom designed and produced race medals were awarded to entrants who met certain race time and distance metrics.
- Race Flyer. Posted through out the city of Natchez, Mississippi to ensure that all residents knew of their opportunity to participate.
- T-shirts. Given away as memorial promotional items to all participants and available for sale to non-participants.
