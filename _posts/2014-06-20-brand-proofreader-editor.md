#### About the Client

Miss Red Pen is a remote, available for hire, proofreading and editorial service.

#### Design Inspiration

The logo incorporates words, books, and a whimsical typeface to communicate how easy it is to work with Miss Red Pen. To further the message of the service, in lieu of a business card, Miss Red Pen gives away small notebooks with contact information. The colros evoke editorial comments, traditionally written in red ink, and display a handwritten, personal feeling.
