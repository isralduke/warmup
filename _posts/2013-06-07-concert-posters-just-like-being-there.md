excerpt: What’s the relationship between art and music? I think that music can be enjoyed over and over again by the musician playing the song and the fan listening to the music. But art can only be done once, just like that one concert you attended and loved.

What&rsquo;s the relationship between art and music? I think that music can be enjoyed over and over again by the musician playing the song and the fan listening to the music. But art can only be done once, just like that one concert you attended and loved. <!--more-->

I got into art and design because of a couple of reasons, one of which was album art. I had a blast watching other creatives talk shop about their influences, be it music or the visual arts.

<a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/poster-documentary-just-like-being-there-is-now-on-netflix-instant/" title="Just Like Being There" target="_blank">Just Like Being There is a documentary about gig posters</a>, those posters designed just for a specific concert for a specific band and a specific time. Many poster designers and printers are interviewed and you get an interesting glimpse into a famous poster printing gurus. No, we hadn&rsquo;t heard of many of the designers or even many of the bands, but it was refreshing shock of joy that a traditional mode of mass replication is still thriving in the digital age.

While this documentary might not be for everyone, if you&rsquo;re really into music and/or art, then it&rsquo;s definitely for you.

Just Like Being There is available to stream on NetFlix.
