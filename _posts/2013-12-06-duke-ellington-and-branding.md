Duke Ellington is doubtless one of the top names in jazz, if not 20th century American music.

First, let&rsquo;s admit that we had to post a link to the linked article because it mentioned Duke and Branding together in the first paragraph. Yet, we&rsquo;re also confident that some readers will enjoy this article.

The New York Times has an article on the amalgamation that made Duke Ellington the icon of image, social relevance, and pure talent. Despite alleged flaws and missteps, and whatever some make him, Duke Ellington is a name that will continue to inspire many musicians to come. The readers should draw their own conclusions.
