AirBNB is a service that allows travelers to rent other people’s places in lieu of costly hotels or inconvenient hostels. Their recent rebrand has caused a stir.

AirBNB’s new logo has some people angry and some happy.

Their new logo is a combination of the location symbols that we find in maps and GPS systems and a heart turned upside-down. It’s very appropriate for their offering, but there are accusations against it.

One such accusation is that it looks too much like the current logo of a software firm.

Research is necessary to design a logo to make sure that a unique market identifier is created. Yet, with millions and millions of logos in the world, could any one person or even one team create something completely unique anymore?

However, as the marks being compared aren’t in the same sector, is the similarity even a problem?
