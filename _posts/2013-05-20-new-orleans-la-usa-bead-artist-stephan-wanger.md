Self-taught artist Stephan Wanger employs a unique mosaic art form which uses recycled Mardi Gras beads. Wanger employs a unique mosaic art form which uses recycled Mardi Gras beads individually hand-cut, molded and arranged to depict beautiful scenes of Louisiana — from the 42 foot panoramic view of New Orleans with 1.4 million beads, to the vast white cotton fields of North Louisiana, to beignets and boiled crawfish in Cajun country.

Wanger is a native of Germany who moved from Chicago to New Orleans in 2005 to help rebuild after Hurricane Katrina.

The exhibit is on display in Denham Springs, Louisiana, at the Old City Hall from 3 May 2013 until 16 June. Admission is free.
