<h4>Stakeholder Information</h4>
<p>College sports’ recruting efforts are competitive, no big surprise. Several universities’ athletics departments are the primary stakeholders for these sports marketing iPad apps.</p>
<h4>Primary User Information</h4>
<p>The primary user for these iPad apps are high school athletes, very often male, who are choosing between universities for the beginning of their athletic careers. They are atracted to images of power, physical prowess, and accomplishment. When they enagage in visual media, it’s often sports media such as ESPN, games between teams, or video games featuring sports competitions. I drew from those types of image inspiration to inform my design choices.</p>
#### Addendum
<p>The company I worked for at the time these apps were produced is no longer in business. Further, sadly, the apps are no longer available on the iTunes App Store as they’re no longer maintained.</p>
