I am extremely pleased to have found this cover that I drew from back in 1997 because I lost the originals a very, very long time ago.

Thanks to the Flickr user who for posted these online! I can’t see your feed anymore, but I’m grateful.

The comic title was <a href="http://www.ink19.com/issues_F/98_02/wet_ink/print/150_rude_tales_nf.html" title="Rude Tales Description" target="_blank">Rude Tales, a ska-oriented anthology of stories edited by Ralph Walters, Jr</a>. Sadly, the comic isn’t published any longer, but I’m thankful to Mr Walters for the opportunity to draw for the title. During that time I created many illustrations under the moniker “Chris Duke,” before coming to use my birth name.
