<a href="http://batonrouge.startupweekend.org" title="Baton Rouge Startup Weekend" target="_blank">Baton Rouge Startup Weekend</a> is an event that thrusts creative, technical, and business people together to launch a business in 54 hours. It's part of <a href="http://startupweekend.org" title="Startup Weekend" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a>, global organization designed to merge ideas and people to start a business.

<a href="http://isralduke.name" title="isral duke is an illustrator, Designer" target="_blank">Isral Duke</a>, our Director, took part in the Baton Rouge event from 16 – 19 August 2013. While he didn't sleep very much, he says he was really inspired by the weekend. (We're even laughing at his choice of his words.)

<blockquote>
“It’s a little bit awkward right now,” participant Isral Duke says. “You’re trying to meet people and show off, but you don’t want to step on other’s people’s toes.”
