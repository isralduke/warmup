#### About the Client

Dazifarm Designs, a custom jeweller, wanted a new brand evocative of its Persian family heritage.

#### Design Inspiration

I looked to Persian art across history and the typeforms featured in the typographical artwork in the client’s office. I used a blue I saw frequently in ancient Persian art across the web from sources such as the Louvre and British Museums and I used a muted gold to signify a calm grounding. For the logo mark, I decided to portray the client’s initials in a form influenced by her father’s handwriting.
