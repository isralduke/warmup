What is a logo? For businesses, organizations, it&rsquo;s a mark that represents the essence of what your business does, what your organization accomplishes. But is it static or dynamic?

An interesting challenge to the fixed logo concept is a new logo for <a href="http://whitney.org" title="The Whitney Art Museum's Website" target="_blank">the Whitney art museum</a>. <a href="http://www.printmag.com/editors-picks/you-decide-is-this-a-logo/" title="Is this a logo?" target="_blank">Their new logo is designed to adapt to the context, rather than be constrained by the available space.</a> Their new logo is appropriate because they provide a service which is visual in nature. Showcasing a myriad of artworks for the public to enjoy, allows them to successfully piggyback their brand upon <em>someone else&rsquo;s product!</em> Now that&rsquo;s a wonderful benefit such a business.

Your company&rsquo;s logo might always look the same, no matter where it&rsquo;s being applied, whether buttons, business cards, or vehicle decals. But what about website favorite icons, iPhone or iPad home screen shortcut icons, or promotional items on which the space is limited? Does it look ugly at a small size? Is it harder to read?

While the Whitney gallery&rsquo;s logo might be visually too extreme for your business or organization, have you considered how well your brand&rsquo;s responds to the challenges of the viewing scenarios on a dynamic market place? For example, can it be fit into an icon or a stylus and preserve its visual integrity?
