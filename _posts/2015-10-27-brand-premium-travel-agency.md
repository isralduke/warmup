#### About the Client

Roux Luxury Travel is a premium travel agency which creates custom travel packages for business owners and executives who need some dedicated time to unwind.

#### Design Inspiration

Roux Luxury Travel wants to bring busy professionals where they love to go. Roux Luxury Travel doesn’t book plane flights, it coordinates destination-based excursions wherever their clients likes to spend time recharging. To this aspect of their unique selling point, I used energetic, but not frenetic colors. Combining the familiar heart and map pin elements, and the name “Roux,” we communicate the careful planning and custom nature of their clients’ wishes.
