Pablo Picasso is credited for having given his opinion that good artists borrow while great artists steal. Last time I checked, people expect some sort of compensation for their efforts, even if only kudos and respect. Popular figure P. Diddy seems to offer neither to Canadian graphic artist <a href="http://www.bantjes.com/" target="_blank">Marian Bantjes</a>. 

Artists of any medium must put time into their work. There is no formula for creating a masterpiece except for effort, time, and more effort, as Thomas Edison, the inventor, said, “None of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.” Edison’s statement may be repurposed “None of [the artworks come by accident.] [The artist sees] a worthwhile need to be met and [they] make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.” This commitment which brings something new into existence is not merely a casual nod to the universe in which one thing must always be traded for something else. Effort is the final and ultimate ingredient which can only be provided by artist working directly upon the work.

People who blatantly steal others’ works (where no express usage permission is given) are violating the principles of matter of energy, obstructing the recent initiatives for sustainability, even if only on a metaphysical level. Especially in the day and age of sampling and barely reworking — (something P. Diddy knows well) — in a context and world where <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/what-is-cc">Creative Commons</a> works are plenty to be had (many of whom only ask attribution) such an outright theft is not excusable. I strongly offer that P. Diddy would not be too pleased with his output being freely shared among nonpaying downloaders. 

None of this is to say that creatives types don’t ever borrow from each other. In fact, the honest creatives are always being inspired by other creatives in all of the creative fields. Ask any artist. The difference is that artists with integrity will always make their inspirations known and always offer something in return to the person from whom they received the inspiration. Even the New Testament writer Paul strongly advocated a similar sentiment in <a href="http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=1Ti&chapter=5#n31">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, “Elders who provide effective leadership must be counted worthy  of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching (<em>New English Translation</em>)."

Hopefully the theft won’t prove too fruitful as the stolen goods (they have stolen artwork on them) aren’t selling too well, according to the <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662488/did-sean-john-blatantly-rip-off-pentagram-s-poster-for-yale-architecture-school" target="_blank">Fast Company article</a>.
