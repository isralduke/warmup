Let me start by positing that humanity is not the center of the universe, and explanations as such, even those earnestly used to emphasize God's love for us, are incorrect by Biblical metrics.  To begin with, Christ made everything (1). We are also told that God the Father (in that form which He knows Himself to be) has placed all things under Christ and given them all to Him (2). Further, given that only Christ could redeem humanity (3) and even repair existence from its inherent entropy (4) it stands to reason that the center of existence and all possible dimensions and potential existences is Christ. 

The Bible uses masculine terms for God, both for the “Father” and the “Son.” This gender use does not imply an anthropocentric view of God, it suggests that God intends for us to understand our relation to Him. When we say “mother” Earth, we acknowledge the myriad of involved facts relating to humanity’s source material and physical origin, as we know well from biology and even astronomy. This powerful feminine term for the Earth does not necessarily imply a human-centric model for the Earth, it merely uses a human term to communicate a relationship. It might even be poetically acknowledged that we have a “father” God and a “mother” Earth.

Now, while I am not a linguist or a translator, the original languages of the Bible have been translated into many other languages, sure, but the source languages (three if I understand correctly: Hebrew, Greek, and even some Aramaic) are the metric against which we measure the integrity of the end-language translations that we have today. In this, the original languages of the Bible offer no clue to God’s appearance, except in Hebrews 1:3, and that was sharply specific and literal. In fact, the early parts of the Bible actually forbid any image of God from being made! (6)

The classical notion of the bearded guy is absurd and surely can’t be abandoned too quickly. Many of the images that have come to be associated with Biblical entities, including angelic creatures, are later European artistic devices, created sometime around the illuminated manuscripts, used to educate the illiterate about Biblical passages. Yet, whether they were created for communication or doctrinal enforcement, the images are still incorrect. If we are to use any image for the Biblical God, we must use the image in which He was well pleased (7, 5).

Humanity, at least per Genesis and the Gospel of John, emerged into existence in God’s image. Christ specifically is God the Father’s own exact image of Himself (5, 8). The citations from John’s Gospel and from Hebrews would suggest that humans are made in an image for Christ, who Himself is the perfect image of God the Father. I think that we have been formed in that image for Christ to understand what The Father says of Himself when He uses His own image, Christ, to speak.

The original question asks whether God exists. I have meandered so that I could embrace several bluestones along the way. While our models of life do tend to be personifications at worst, they do not exclude God’s existence: a faulty model doesn’t disprove a phenomenon. I offer that God exists; and as suggested by the Bible, His existence is what explains why we search all existences for meaning using a vague, yet shiny, blurry image of ourselves.
