#### About the Client

Crossroads Community Church is an assembly of readers who want to strive for a correct understanding of the bible before drawing conclusions about their doctrine. They wanted a muted, but stark logo to represent their faith position. They hold that as a church they are not important, that the importance is the redemptive work of Jesus Christ on the cross and the victorious resurrection.
