#### The Problem
The client has a Content Management System powering their website. They can edit and change things whenever the want. It’s perfect and well-structured. The only problem is that they still want me to edit their site for them.

The client has been trained to use the CMS, they have lots of documentation with clear examples too. What is wrong here?

#### It’s the Control Panel

After some reflection on clients’ feedback, I think the Control Panel is one culprit.

The Control Panel is one of the primary aspects that should be considered as part of the client’s experience with their content managemnt system (CMS) powered site. The client may not think about the Control Panel itself, but rather how easy, or hard, it is for them to edit their site. So, the Control Panel should be configured so that your client can easily use it.

#### Use Their Language

Great communication happens when you speak your audience’s langauge. So, why not use the client’s own language in their site’s Control Panel? To the extent possible, the Control Panel should use the same language that your client uses in their own work day.

Here’s an example from a family growth organization. They don’t think in terms of data points, permissions, or roles like we in the tech and dev world do. They think about _Family Members_ and these members’ roles in their organizational family. So, why not use those same words?

The client, in their own day, isn’t creating data files, post types, or entries, they’re growing their own family. They know more about their family members than we can, so let them describe their family in their own words.

#### Tell Them how It Relates to the Site

It’s a well-known fact, a user experience maxim, that <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/" title="UX Research Demonstrating that Labels Help Users." target="_blank">form labels help people complete forms</a>. As the Control Panel is basically a set of forms dedicated to editing their site, use these labels liberally, and in the client’s own language. This means we should name the fields with their words and offer explanations how the content fits into their organization.

In the Video fields, I explain to the clients what happens when they input the YouTube link. Knowing the result they get helps them to visualize what I am asking for in this field.

#### What About the Data They’re Creating?

Of course, part of making the control panel great for the client means that I have to cosnider my own experience too. As I am creating spaces for their information, I need to find the best way to encode their goals into data. Everything the client adds is data. While we are collecting data, we have to consider how to best represent in data what we’re asking the client to input into the Control Panel. The data’s representation affects how we can manipulate it on the site.

You can see that Family Members’ roles are represented as checkboxes as these Family Members can have more than one role. Oh, and when they talk about their Family Member, they may want some basic text formatting too.

#### Earn their Trust, Create a Great Experience

When the Client feels at ease with the Control Panel, they will feel confident about updating their own site. It seems a small thing in our own techie eyes, but it means the world to them in saved time in their workday. In the case of the family growth organization, it means they can spend time growing families instead of laboring over an email trying to explain to me what they want changed.

When you use empathy in developing the Control Panel of your own CMS-powered site work, or web application, you will also find that a little empathy goes a long way.
