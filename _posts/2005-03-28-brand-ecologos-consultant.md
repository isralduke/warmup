#### About the Client

EcoLogos wants to help businesses become better environmental stewards. Founder Tara Mundi wants to show businesses that just as we must use our economic resources wisely, so we must use our environmental resources wisely too. Something responsibily used and cared for will continue to provide dividends. If we care for the environment, we can use it more. Their name is a play on conversations and dialogue. 

#### Design Inspiration

_Logos_ is greek for “word” and the logo is also a play on word exchanges, and environmental dialogue.
