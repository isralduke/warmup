Nelson Mandela, a pivotal figure in South Africa's history, passed away on 5 December 2013.

In response to this historic event, we have designed a simple poster using one of his statements as the central idea. You can read more about the thought behind the design at the project page.

The textured background of the poster, which appears to be scribbles, is actually the word “ignorance” repeated many times, in a variety of rough, unrefined handwriting styles; this symbolizes the pre-education condition. Mandela’s education quote exhibits light and clarity differentiating itself from a background of chaos.
