Slack is a popular messaging and productivity app for business that aims to replace email, file storage, and innovate a new way to power project communication.

Web professionals in Baton Rouge, LA have worked together to form a community using Slack as their central point of communication. As Duke Branding&rsquo;s director is a member of the Baton Rouge Slack community he accepted the call to design an icon for the community.
