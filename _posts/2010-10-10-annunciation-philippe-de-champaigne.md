“The Annunciation” by Philippe de Champaigne, c.1648,  is an item in the <a href="http://www.wallacecollection.org/">Wallace Collection</a>, a privately held collection in London, UK.

“The Annunciation” by Philippe de Champaigne, is unlike many paintings of this subject, when the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would bear The Messiah, in that it approaches the subject from an angle different from the predominantly Catholic value points that we’ve seen from the Renaissance. <em>(This post is not about Catholic bashing, it merely serves to demonstrate how a value point can influence an artist.)</em>

In this painting, the represented story is the one one which Mary recieves word that she’s to bear the Messiah, made possible by The Holy Spirit.
While Mary is the object of the painting, as it centers around the message she receives form the angel, she is not the object. The subject of this piece is The Triunity of God. Mary isn’t dishonored in the slightest, as we’ll see later. 

Here’s where the members of The Triunity are located in this painting. The angel Gabriel points upwards to the dove (the official Biblically-stated symbol for The Holy Spirit) is the first clue that the subject is The Trinunity, of which The Holy Spirit is an integral part. The Holy Spirit is the agent of Mary’s pregnancy. Then, we have the light emanating from the top of the painting which is The Father; in the Gospels we are told, by Jesus, that no one has ever seen The Father, so light seems to be a good choice. We also know that The Father directs the actions and words of Jesus The Son and the The Father also directs the actions of The Holy Spirit too.  Many of the cherubim are looking towards The Holy Spirit and The Father, an additional signal that the subject of this work is The Triunity. Some of the cherubim look at Mary, who we know has been chosen to bear Jesus, and this is where Jesus The Son is located in this painting. Jesus The Son is depicted implicitly in this work as there is no direct symbol for Him other than those cherubim looking at Mary and the angel Gabriel's announcement.

That this work depicts all three members of The Triunity as the focal points, featuring Mary as the object rather than the subject, is the evidence that the painter, Philippe de Champaigne, was painting this work from his own non-Catholic value point or he may have been representing this for a patron who was not Catholic.

This work, very lovely in technique and skill, also incorporates an understanding of theology, either for the artist himself for the patron. In either case, it beautifully describes the The Triunity as the orchestrator and true subject of the Gospels. Mary, who is frequently — if not always — depicted as both object and subject in many Renaissance paintings which render this story. As she is not the subject here, she is honored in that she is chosen to bear the Messiah, the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Luke 1:317ndash;32 reads, “ Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him  Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.”
