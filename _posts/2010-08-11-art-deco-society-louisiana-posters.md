The Art Deco Society of Louisiana (ADSL) promotes awareness of the rich aesthetic hsitory of Art Deco in Louisiana, USA. 

Art Deco was an art movement in the United States during the early twentieth century. A favored style with Huey Long, arguably the most colorful figure in Louisiana politics, he instructed that the Louisiana state capitol building to designed in the Art Deco style. 

Offered the chance to design a series of five posters for ADSL to promote their educational excursions, I eagerly accepted the opporuntity. A fan of Art Deco myself and the Louisiana state capitol building, I was delighted to design the ADSLâ€™s posters.

If you wish, click any of the large images below and you can see a very high-resolution PDF of all of the posters.
