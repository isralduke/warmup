<h4>The Audience</h4>
<p>The audience for this-t-shirt design is the fans of the football team of the university where I got my Bachelor’s in Fine Arts for Graphic Design. I wasn’t only thinking of the core fanbase, but a subset of the fan base which is loyal a certain comic book property.</p>
<h4>Credits</h4>
<p>The idea for the Tiger Signal is credited to <a href="http://www.patrickrills.com/" target="_blank">Patrick Rills</a>, a software developer who loves Batman and the LSU Tigers. The concept is that the LSU football stadium, with its bright, powerful lights blasting into the night on Saturday nights (during American college football season) is like a beacon that calls to the fans, not unlike the one to which the caped crusader responds.

<p>This design was created for a t-shirt vendor, <a href="http://www.collegedistrict.com/" target="_blank">College District</a>, licensed by the LSU Athletic Association. I do not hold or claim any rights to the visual elements that comprise the brand of the LSU Tigers.
