As the process was scheduled to be completed within a couple of years, they needed a way to use a single set of credentials for each employee to simplify some of the internal friction of the systems’ transition. The solution was to build a single sign on system to use across their locations and systems.  #### User Experience Concerns  With over 100 employees across multiple locations and various technology comfort levels, I had to design a friendly, entry-level method to get credentials from each employee. Several conditions outside of the organization’s control meant that the process for gaining employee comfort and timely credential completion was less than ideal. We used simple language and a guided user flow to make the whole process as easy as possible. Working directly with an infrastructure and system architect, I devised a simple interface for the employees to use across their devices as not every employee had access to larger screens such as tablets or larger screens.  #### Further Design Considerations  Along with modernizing its internal systems and workflows, the organization was also pursuing a rebrand! This was an excellent opportunity to introduce the employees to the new brand system. "

Their results stem from their use of personality alignments with educational theory to produce learning materials. Their philosophy holds that leaders should be the first to initiate positive change.  #### Design Inspiration  Their logo mark is inspired by a team of people pulling together, with the leader first in line to do the work. As the name of their business is long, we abbreviated it down to just “THA”. In a fascinating development, we learned that a phonetic sounding of “THA” as “ta” also sounds like a Vietnamese word for “forgiveness.” As their philosophy incorporates human relationships, this revelation made for a nice bit of completion."

I used a blue I saw frequently in ancient Persian art across the web from sources such as the Louvre and British Museums and I used a muted gold to signify a calm grounding.

From the design phase to construction completion, the entire project took only one semester!  #### Graphic Design Celebrates Architecture  With another student, Alise Johnson, on the graphic part of the project, we decided to portray the architecture class’s accomplishment as a 91cm (36 inch), six panel, fold out, double-sided brochure. The fold out aspect describes how the project materialized, it slowly unfolded. The connecting graphic elements to the brochure describe how each phase in the students’ learning and participating connected to them the family who received the house. We used a montage of photos and drawings produced during the project to illustrate the uncommon path to completion.  #### Outcome  David Baird, the professor who led the students, was excited to have graphic designers on his team. When Alise and I earned the Silver Addy, David Baird shared our excitement. We helped to render his ideas for community housing in a visuall exciting way."

The logo needed to be simple enough for small stickers, but feature the entire business name while communicating what they do. A tennis show mid-step was the perfect solution.

We were taught by our professors and mentors that we should never detract from the legibility of the message. <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/17248892?story_id=17248892&fsrc=rss"" target=""_blank"">A recent article by The Economist</a> cites material that challenges this commonly-held maxim. </p> <h4>Uh, Oh, New Information</h4> <!--more--> <p>Studies by Princeton University psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer used 28 volunteers, aged 18 to 40, to review material about fictional alien species and then tested them on the material presented. Those who read the material in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni"">Bodoni</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_sans"">Comic Sans</a>, harder to read fonts than the control font <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial"">Arial</a>, retained more of the material. <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/17248892?story_id=17248892&fsrc=rss"">You can read the article by The Economist</a> to learn more in-depth information about the types of material asked of the volunteers. (Why didn't they use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica"">Helvetica</a> instead of Arial?) </p> <h4>Design Questions</h4> <p>This raises some questions for me because as a designer my primary mission is to make knowledge more accessible through visual means such as color, form, visual rhythm, and, of course, font selections. </p> <p>For starters, what was the demographic of the volunteers to this test? If the volunteers were all science fiction fans, the test might not be indicative as the truest and bravest of science fictions thrive on <strong>retaining and showing off</strong> their knowledge about these things. (Can anyone say <strong>fanboy</strong>?) If the test group had some artists or designers in the group, then the results could be skewed a little more as these types (this includes me) are <strong>already geared</strong> for seeing the material as they look past presentation anyway. But, if the demographic was better balanced than these, or had none of them, then the results merit the argument that designers, artists and advertising types recheck their presuppositions about legibility and reading ease. </p> <h4>Flexibility!</h4> <p>The immediate upshot that comes to my mind is that now designers would have even greater flexibility in choosing typefaces and fonts for their projects. The spirit of the letters would be released to an ever greater freedom for making impressions upon the designer for the message's final visual manifestation. </p> <p>Of course, now the designers can have more fun in the projects or face greater challenges in arguing against the clients’ use of horrible fonts such as Arial, Papyrus, or Comic Sans. </p> <p>Photo from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://quenya101.com/category/latin/"" title="""">Quenya101</a> </p>"

They can edit and change things whenever the want. It’s perfect and well-structured. The only problem is that they still want me to edit their site for them.  The client has been trained to use the CMS, they have lots of documentation with clear examples too. What is wrong here?  #### It’s the Control Panel  After some reflection on clients’ feedback, I think the Control Panel is one culprit.  <figure> 	<img class=""img-fluid shadow-small mb-2"" src=""https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/website-user-experience-st-elizabeth-stun-design-isral-duke-5.png"" alt=""The basic Control Panel screen for this Case Study""> 	<figcaption>The basic Control Panel screen for this Case Study</figcaption> </figure>  The Control Panel is one of the primary aspects that should be considered as part of the client’s experience with their content managemnt system (CMS) powered site. The client may not think about the Control Panel itself, but rather how easy, or hard, it is for them to edit their site. So, the Control Panel should be configured so that your client can easily use it.  #### Use Their Language  Great communication happens when you speak your audience’s langauge. So, why not use the client’s own language in their site’s Control Panel? To the extent possible, the Control Panel should use the same language that your client uses in their own work day.  Here’s an example from a family growth organization. They don’t think in terms of data points, permissions, or roles like we in the tech and dev world do. They think about _Family Members_ and these members’ roles in their organizational family. So, why not use those same words?  <figure> 	<img class=""img-fluid shadow-small mb-2"" src=""https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/website-user-experience-st-elizabeth-stun-design-isral-duke-4.png"" alt=""The screen in the Control Panel in which the client creates Family Members""> 	<figcaption>The screen in the Control Panel in which the client creates “Family Members”</figcaption> </figure>  The client, in their own day, isn’t creating data files, post types, or entries, they’re growing their own family. They know more about their family members than we can, so let them describe their family in their own words.  #### Tell Them how It Relates to the Site  It’s a well-known fact, a user experience maxim, that <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/"" title=""UX Research Demonstrating that Labels Help Users."" target=""_blank"">form labels help people complete forms</a>. As the Control Panel is basically a set of forms dedicated to editing their site, use these labels liberally, and in the client’s own language. This means we should name the fields with their words and offer explanations how the content fits into their organization.  <figure> 	<img class=""img-fluid shadow-small mb-2"" src=""https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/website-user-experience-st-elizabeth-stun-design-isral-duke-6.png"" alt=""The screen in which they talk about their Family Members""> 	<figcaption>The screen in which they talk about their Family Members</figcaption> </figure>  In the Video fields, I explain to the clients what happens when they input the YouTube link. Knowing the result they get helps them to visualize what I am asking for in this field.  #### What About the Data They’re Creating?  Of course, part of making the control panel great for the client means that I have to cosnider my own experience too. As I am creating spaces for their information, I need to find the best way to encode their goals into data. Everything the client adds is data. While we are collecting data, we have to consider how to best represent in data what we’re asking the client to input into the Control Panel. The data’s representation affects how we can manipulate it on the site.  <figure> 	<img class=""img-fluid shadow-small mb-2"" src=""https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/website-user-experience-st-elizabeth-stun-design-isral-duke-3.png"" alt=""Screenshot showing how input fields are mapped to data types""> 	<figcaption>Screenshot showing how input fields are mapped to data types</figcaption> </figure>  You can see that Family Members’ roles are represented as checkboxes as these Family Members can have more than one role. Oh, and when they talk about their Family Member, they may want some basic text formatting too.  #### Earn their Trust, Create a Great Experience  When the Client feels at ease with the Control Panel, they will feel confident about updating their own site. It seems a small thing in our own techie eyes, but it means the world to them in saved time in their workday. In the case of the family growth organization, it means they can spend time growing families instead of laboring over an email trying to explain to me what they want changed.  When you use empathy in developing the Control Panel of your own CMS-powered site work, or web application, you will also find that a little empathy goes a long way.  <p>You can <a href=""/projects/website-adoption-agency"" target=""_blank"">see more images</a> from the design of their site. </p>"

Further, the colors of her violin and viola informed the color choices in her logo, deep wooden reds, and sonically-rich ebonies. To set herself apart, she didn’t want to plain or literal image of a violin. The focus is on her as a musician who performs, not on the instrument."

The logo sprouts from the Episcopal tradition but isn’t limited to it, but rather grows from it. Further, the negative space around the burgundy center creates an _ichthys_, or the legacy Christian fish. The typefaces evoke modernity and a strong educational history."

The workshops are usually oriented around real, hands-on experience with guided mentoring during a project. The speakers are industry professionals who bring years of experience and a valuable project experience. Finally, in the hackathon, participants use real data to build projects on a theme of civic improvement.  #### Attendee Rewards  Attendees to Activate Conference don’t just get invaluable knowledge, education, and professional development. Their admission price includes a bag of giveaways from sponsors and conference promotional material. Among the conference’s own promotional items was this poster, designed to suggest that attendees would travel to high altitudes in their careers.  #### Design Strategy  The rocket subject of the poster is taken from Activate Conference’s own logomark. By setting it among an outer space inspired backdrop, it suggests new discoveries and exploratory experiences. The outer space backdrop also serves as a visual device to bring the rocket forward in the picture place. It does this because it is darker than the dark colors of the Activate Conference logo. The pixelesque nature hints at the display mechanisms of modern electronic devices.       "

The design of the icon (see the image below) is inspired by the traditionally-known shape of the state of Lousiana, a billfold, and an angle bracket frequently seen in website code.</p> <p>La Wallet is a product, developed and owned by <a href=""http://envoc.com"" target=""_blank"">Envoc.com</a>. I worked for Envoc, when the app was in development. I worked on the  the UX and UI for the app. Additonally, social media promotion images were also created for the press releases.</p> <h4>UX Considerations</h4> <p>Early in the design phase, I championed the incorporation of a dark mode into the app. The dark mode would be especially useful for evening traffic stops, which would allow the traffic officer to clearly see the license details on the screen without being momentarily blinded. We don’t want the traffic offices to experience the bright phone in the theatre effect.</p> <p>Another user-centric feature of the app is one-click access to the important license information.

One such event was held in New Orleans, LA. Former co-worker, fellow designer <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-alford-a12a1495/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Alford</a> and I attended the event as a team and we called ourselves the “Punomatics.” These events, usually held every year, are produced around the challenge of using a single app from their Creative Cloud suite to meet a design challenge. The Creative Jam I participated in with Michael was organized around Adobe XD, a user experience and user interface design and prototyping app.</p> <p>Michael and I took home People&rsquo;s Choice First Place Award and Judge&rsquo;s Second Place Award and you can <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/66242371/New-Orleans-Creative-Jam-2018"" title=""See Isral Duke in 2018 Adobe XD Creative Jam in New Orleans"" target=""_blank"">read about it here.</a> We faced tough colleagues in this challenge and we havent even used Adobe XD very much before this! Serious high fives to Judge&rsquo;s First Place Award, Team Mood Board Killers Tara Hebert and Bo Kim.</p> <h4>The Challenge</h4> <p>Participants must design an app concept within the three hour window. After the three hour time limit, participants must present and defend their work to the audience and a professional panel of judges.</p> <h4>The Theme</h4> <p>Adobe provided the theme, “Let’s do it again“ for the central guiding aspect of the challege.</p> <p>Michael and I decided to tune our approach to the theme using a play on the sound of “do it” as “duet” and we prototyped a karaoke app. Also, being just Michael and me, it was a visual duet. See what I did there? </p> <p>As this competition required that we design the app’s user interface in three hours, we had no time for user testing! Don’t hold that against us! We’re inspired by Adobe’s challenge, but the app’s user interface is informed by user experience concepts that we assembled from day job experience and even ambient knowledge that we have gleaned as user experience-focused interactive designers. </p> <h4>The User Experience</h4> <ol> 	<li>Always consider the users and their context. You won’t design an app which resonates with the users unless it meets them where they are.</li> 	<li>We chose subdued colors because the lower brightness values will be respectful in the darker environment of bars (where else do people do karaoke?). These muted brightness values cause less optical strain, especially in darker environments. Don&rsquo;t blind your users!</li> 	<li>Super simple user interface! Knowing that karaoke is usually held in lounges, we know that the participants have <em>voluntarily</em> decreased their <em>cognitive abilities.</em>. Yes, I know it’s anecdotal and not data-enlightened.</li> 	<li>No account setup. Sober people sometimes have a hard time setting up user accounts. Do you think that inebriated users will be more or less successful?</li> </ol> <h4>The Developer Experience</h4> <p><strong></strong>This app won’t be difficult to develop (says the design guy!). The nature of such an app affords us the opportunity to drastically simplify the feature set, which accommodates a simpler user interface.<span></span> </p> <ol> 	<li>No account setup. Less administrative overhead for the lounges which serve up this app.</li> 	<li>Each round of competition is a new one, so the data is throw-away data. We don’t need to implement complicated data stores.</li> 	<li>Karaoke competitions are throw-away events. We don’t have to retain statistics or analytics or even session data for more than 1 night. Maybe even a couple of hours at most!</li> </ol> <h4>The Outcome</h4> <p>As the awards in the additional images demonstrate, we tied with another team for People’s Choice Award and we earned second place in the Professional Judges’ Award too. The other teams were phenomenal and we were nervous facing such stiff competition. Congrats to the first place winners! </p>"

Most users for whom I have designed sites, or user interfaces have not been technically-oriented people, they are oriented around their own industry, and thus the language of that industry. For non-technical, people-centric users, the control panel would have to be very approachable. </p> <p>The fields which they use to create data were labelled in friendly terms using their own language. The help text under the fields offered use-case scaenarios within the helper text.

This language required rewording many terms in the control panel and across in-depth training documents. They wanted to use the control panel to feature certain testimonials but sometimes those testimonials would require that specific other testimonials be excluded from public presentation for legal purposes. The take home for me was that data should mimic the people for whom it’s being put to use and that the user experience should be crafted around their specific needs. </p> <h4>In-Depth</h4> <p>You can <a href=""/articles/empathy-control-panel"" target=""_blank"">read a more in-depth review of the thinking</a> involved for building the control panel for the client. </p>"

Decisions regarding UI and UX details, and even features in the app, were critiqued along that primary constraint. Constraints are important as they guide many development and design decisions. </p> <p>We began with simple pencil and paper sketches in a notebook. Some of the hand sketches featured below are limited to features which appear in the App Store version of the app. </p> <p>Squiddle is inspired by sticky notes, the square ones that come in a variety of colors, with a thin strip of adhesive. Sticky notes are temporary, disposable (for better of for worse), and meant to quickly cpature ideas. Corresponding to the real world items, the app has simple drawing tools and a simple interface. The user can choose pen sizes, ink colors, note background colors which are taken from actual sticky notes. But to break from the correspondence to the real world, Squiddle can can import a photo as the background. </p> <h4>Design & Development</h4> <p>As I designed the user interface I looked to the to works by many of the Bauhaus legends and even the great Dieter Rams.

But do the images we use   affect how the message is perceived? images: - image:     alt: Does religious imagery cheapen faith?     url: https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/does-religious-imagery-cheapen-faith-2.jpg ---  #### Images are Useful  Images are useful methods of communication and they are wonderful at encoding information. The cliché “A picture is worth a thousand words” captures the useful aspect of images. But, for vital information, especially information relating to our survival as a species, can an image be enough. I think both “No” and “Yes.” I say “No” because most images have to truncate nuances or compress the informational scope about a topic. I say “Yes” because there is one image that is the object and the subject of its reference.  #### Historic References  Look at the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/12/inside-lascaux-the-versai_n_712645.html"" target=""_blank"">cave paintings of Lascaux, France</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting"" target=""_blank"">Alta Mira, Spain</a> where early people told the stories of their hunts and possibly their social groups’ lives. We used images in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulla_(seal)"" title=""Wikipedia article about Sumerian Bulla."" target=""_blank"">Sumerian Bulla to record business transactions</a>.   So it’s no surprise that we use imagery to communicate religious and spiritual ideas. In fact, religious imagery is a major type of cultural treasure. Think about the <a href=""http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/parthenon.html"" target=""_blank"">Parthenon</a>, the <a href=""http://www.italyguides.it/us/roma/pantheon.htm"" target=""_blank"">Pantheon</a>, the temple<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Angkor_Wat.jpg"" target=""_blank""> Angkor Wat</a>, <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=Michelangelo's+The+Creation+of+Adam+site:.edu&hl=en&lr=&safe=active&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=8_IgTYSJIcLflge--YnSCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CAsQ_AU&biw=1046&bih=1234"" target=""_blank"">Michelangelo’s ""The Creation of Adam,""</a>  <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=golden+pavilion+temple&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234"" target=""_blank"">The Golden Pavillion of Kyoto</a>, the varied <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=illuminated+manuscript&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234"" target=""_blank"">illuminated manuscripts by the monks of pre-Renaissance Europe,</a> and yes, the <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=pyramids+of+giza&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1046&bih=1234"" target=""_blank"">Pyramids in Egypt</a>. And, lately we’ve seen the frenetic pace of first responders’ actions in saving the art treasures in the 2019 fire at Notre Dame in Paris. These are all religious treasures which represent the finest efforts of their creators and their adherents.   Whether one considers themselves a member of the respective beliefs to which these items are associated or not, the artistic and construction qualities of these works can’t be debated. These images are themselves sketches of something else, sketches of unseen realities as portrayed by human hands from some idea gotten by the heads which control those hands. They seek to understand the as-of-yet unseen things in their yearnings of something other.  #### Our Values  The image featured above can never be associated with the same system for which Michelangelo painted the <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=sistine+chapel&hl=en&safe=active&prmd=ivnsb&source=lnms&tbs=isch:1&ei=GvggTdeEC8Oblgfl0M3HCw&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&ved=0CA4Q_AU&biw=1046&bih=1234"" target=""_blank"">Sistine Chapel</a>. The featured image is **religious kitsch**. It’s not created with even the faintest pretense of care or dedication. Look, even the packaging is hastily assembled. It will forever only be associated with the temple of quick and dirty materialism, preying upon the _(hopefully)_ sincere-yet-misled. This can not be associated with the previously-mentioned masterpieces.  #### Intent is Important  The subject”s construction and artistic quality tell us a lot about the producer’s own value of the subject. The carpenter who builds their own table probably spends extra time on the sanding and refinements. But some artisans may not be as skilled as others, I don’t mean to imply their work is less important or of lower quality. The kitsch we see is probably something that no one would miss if they owned and lost it. The producer obviously sees no value in it either. But, what if the buyer is leaning towards the other represented in the kitsch? Is their own heart just kitsch too?  #### Insufficient Knowledge  To answer that, let’s look to ancient Athens, Greece. The Athenians were intellectually curious and this curiosity gave them the awareness that there would be things they didn’t know. _(I’d even argue that they didn’t think themselves the apex of all culture because of that. A culture would have to be somewhat humble to admit it didn’t know something.)_ When the biblical writer Paul visited Athens in Acts 17, he found a myriad of religious images, even an altar for “the unknown God.” in <a href=""https://netbible.org/bible/Acts+17"" target=""_blank"">Acts 17:34</a>.   The Athenians did a wonderful thing here by admitting to something they didn’t yet know. As a cosmopolitan town, a thinking place, they clearly were aware that they didn’t know some things about the world, even if they were playing it safe with a fail safe approach to being culturally thorough. _(They were more respectful than <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ultimate-modern-art-installation-an-empty-gallery-5384702.html"" targte=""_blank"">some who claim to make art with nothing</a>.)_ By the way, <a href=""https://www.ancient.eu/Athenian_Democracy/"" title=""Athens is the birthplace of democracy"" target=""_blank"">Athens is where democracy popped up</a>. I’m just mentioning this.  To continue along this idea of the unknown idea, let me mention the penman of Hebrews, the biblical book. Paul _(many think he penned this book)_ admits to the insufficiencies of his own faith’s temples and high priests: ""<a href=""http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=8#n1"" target=""_blank"">The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was <strong>warned</strong> by God... (Hebrews 8:5)</a>.""   Just as a photograph of a friend or loved one can never replace the actual person you love, so all of these temples and beautiful art works can never truly transform you to the existence within the ultimate reality towards which  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Duerer-Prayer.jpg"" target=""_blank"" title=""Albrecht Durer, Praying Hands."">Albrecht Dürers hands yearned.</a>   #### The Best Image is Enduring Reality  This is where I think there is one important, vital image. But, we didn’t create this image. In fact, I am convinced that this image created us. This image is the object and the subject of its reference. Jesus is that image.  Before Jesus’ many claims to being one with God, the Son of God, and the Messiah _(He was certainly bold)_, I am not aware of any existing claims like that. He claimed to be ultimate reality. His claim is that belief, sacred construction, sacred words, ceremony, or image are all be embodied in Him. In John 8:58 &sup1;, “Before Abraham, I AM.” Unlike the Athenians, clever as they were, Jesus left no room for that specific unknown. Paul’s shared his sufficient, and specific knowledge of this once unknown now known, with the Athenians in Acts 17.   #### The Perfect Image  Jesus is the exact image of the Father’s own essence, as <a href=""http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=1#n5"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bible verse for Jesus Christ being the Image of God."">we see in Hebrews</a>. Jesus is the crowning instance of a class of artwork, self-portraits by artists themselves. God put Himself into humanity, each member of humanity being made in His image, and in the same moment in which He did this, created all things in such a state so as to enable us to access His self-portrait, allowing us to understand His essence.   If you’ve ever gone to an art museum, looked at a puzzling work of art, and wondered what the hell the artist was up to, then you know what God has prevented: the observer’s ignorance. <a href=""http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Heb&chapter=1#n5"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bible verse for Jesus Christ being the Image of God."">Jesus Christ is the exact image, exact representation of God’s essence.</a> He’s the image and the reference, the reality all in one.  ###### Notes  &sup1; Jesus claimed to be one with The Father.

2019-05-06-real-time-validation.md,"--- title: Arguments for Real-Time Validation date: 2019-05-06 00:00:00 Z excerpt: Should you check a user’s input entry as they type it? A look at the arguments   for real-time input validation. images: - image:     alt: Graphic illustrating success and failure in form entry interactions.     url: https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/real-time-form-validation.svg ---  #### The Scenario  A user or a website visitor is filling out a form. When they finish, they press “Submit” expecting to be finished with the form. But then, to their dismay, the browser kidnaps them and brings them to a page listing problems with the information they entered.   Wouldn’t it be great if the user saw the potential problems before submitting the form? Yes, it would be great and a lot of thought has gone into this problem.  #### Give the User Instant Feedback  Some fields may require some extra thought from the user. Let’s use the password field as an example. It has all sorts of anxiety-producing requirements such as a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, a certain amount of numbers, and maybe certain special characters, but not other special characters. To start, tell them about these special requriements up front. Maybe this can be a help tip, or even better, a list of those requirements.   Now, the extra step for a great user experience would be to check what they entered in the password as soon as they move to the next field. In the industry, we call the event “on blur” when the user moves their entry actions away from a field. Checking the user’s inputted information when they move away from a field is called “On Blur Validation.” Say that at a party sometime soon for strange looks. Well, a party with normal humans.  #### How On Blur Validation is Done  We can show them what needs to be entered. I have already said this, but it nevers hurts to repeat this: show them what you need. Again, we’ll use the password field as an example. Look at the image below. It explains, in simple language, what makes a great and acceptable password.  <figure> 	<img class=""shadow-small mb-2 img-fluid"" src=""https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/on-blur-validation-exhibit-image-1.png"" alt=""An example of a password field.""> 	<figcaption>An example of a password field with requirements explained in simple language.</figcaption> </figure>  Sorry I don’t have a GIF _(say it with a hard “G” sound)_ here, but imagine the user had to wait to see this error message after they tried to submit this. Their work is multipled because they have to come back to a screen they already tried to move on from in their workflow. But, if this message is displayed as soon as they move to a new field, they still have a chance to fix the error with a minimal impact on their attention, workload, and cognitive load.  <figure> 	<img class=""shadow-small mb-2 img-fluid"" src=""https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/on-blur-validation-exhibit-image-2.png"" alt=""An example of the error message.""> 	<figcaption>An example of the error message.</figcaption> </figure>  This approach to validation for the user will esepcially show its return on investment in long, complicated forms. Long forms where backend validation isn’t required can give an easy entry experience to the user because errors show up immediately, they can fix them immediately, and there won’t be any agonizing browser redirects listing painful bullet points of errors to track down.   #### Further Reading  - <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/form-field-validation-errors-only-approach/"" title=""Errors Only Approach to Form Fields Validations"" target=""_blank"">Errors Only Approach to Form Fields Validations</a> - <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/web-form-validation-best-practices-and-tutorials/"" title="""" target=""_blank"">Validate Before They Press Submit</a> - <a href=""https://blog.prototypr.io/ux-best-practices-of-form-validation-ddb8a0df14fd"" title=""Best Practices for Form Validation"" target=""_blank"">Best Practices for Form Validation</a>"

Their approach, to put a mobile app in the hands of the patient, and a web application to a nurse practitioner working remotely, would enable both patient and medical expert to receive and complete a medical visit from home.  #### User Experience Concerns  I worked with them to design the user interface and user experience, in this case medical experts, on the web application. We wireframed many scenarios and use cases to find the quickest way for the medical expert to input diagnosis information within ten minutes, the average length of a visit. Our tactics for achieving such a goal for the medial expert included paring th euser interface down to the most important information the medical expert needs to know. Our subject matter expert, nurses and medical clinic partners, provided a streamlined flow of medical questions.  #### Design Considerations  One tactic I relied upon was to use bright bezels for important information, and muted colors for minor interface and background elements. Medical information screens used colors inspired by hospital scrubs, as <a href=""http://classifieds.usatoday.com/blog/marketplace/what-is-the-meaning-behind-color-coded-scrubs/"" title=""The Reasons for Scrub Colors"" target=""_blank"">these colors have been shown to create a positive atmosphere in hospitals or clinics</a>. Vibrant, saturated colors were then free to be implemented to signal important states or alerts.  The video of the patient would remain static on the diagnosis panel so the medial expert would always have the patient front and center to their eyes. The video is presented in portrait orientation to match the most common hand-to-phone physical relationship.   I used a body font size of 20px, 1.5rem, so that all text would be much easier to scan while scrolling and easier to read. The typeface has a tall x-height for easy screen reading."
2019-05-27-carousel-sliders-negative-results.md,"--- title: Carousels Have Negative Results on Websites date: 2019-05-27 00:00:00 Z excerpt: Carousels appeal to website owners because of the movement and engaging imagery.   But are they good for a website? I argue “no.” images: - image:     alt: Illustration of a cartoon character who has hit himself in the face.     url: https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cartoon-man-hit-himself-in-face.png ---  #### Carousels: Charming or Chaotic?  Carousels are large display feature on websites which contain and alternate between content, often called “slides”. Each slide might be imagery, or maybe there’s a call to action. The slides may move in some direction, or fade between slides. Whatever they contain, they can be popular among website owners.  #### Carried Away  Big images are engaging, something to consider when reading why [more sales conversions happen on tablets than phones](https://www.monetate.com/blog/smartphones-vs-tablets-forrester-reveals-the-differences), and [movement attracts our eyes](http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/staff/alexh/research/papers/HowardHolcombe_APP_2010.pdf), so it’s no surprise your client wants them on their own website. Your client isn’t wrong to want features on their site which they hope would create more conversions. But are carousels the best thing for them?  No. Let me explain.  #### Consider the Cost  For all their visual glory and “wow” factor, carousels come at certain opportunity costs.  According to Google, your [users are probably only seeing the first slide](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/mobile-speed-optimization/). Users start scrolling as soon as the site loads to get a sense of the content. This means they don’t wait for something they probably won’t see. You can read Google’s own marketing report for yourself.  Carousels have heavier download sizes and longer load times. The carousel has to load content for each slide, imagery, videos, or complex animations. [Each slide’s content has to be loaded, whether the user will see them or not](https://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496).  They also require extra controls to communicate their functions to users, unless you want to take control away from the user, which creates distrust. Oh, and [these extra controls often are poorly implemented on phones, creating a terrible experience](https://www.sitepoint.com/unbearable-accessible-slideshow/).  Development time isn’t an issue as there’s many freely-available carousel code packages. However we’re also relying on unknown providers and there’s no guarantee of their code quality. Something that’s free to us now could cost us later. In fact, one popular [WordPress slider actually allowed malware onto websites](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/12/revslider-vulnerability-leads-to-massive-wordpress-soaksoak-compromise.html)!  #### They look cool. I want it.  I understand. These technical arguments aren’t making the point so let me try a different angle. May I appeal to your business sense?   Information overload is a common phenomenon and [carousels can cause banner blindness](https://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html). There are uncountable (at least by a person) websites and apps demanding our attention. With so much competition for our eyes, it’s understandable you want your website to catch the user’s attention. But as carousels will kill conversions, they should be omitted.  Yeast.com, a noted SEO expert, [reports that only 1% of web users interact with carousels](https://yoast.com/opinion-on-sliders/) and then only the first part slide in the carousel. [One half to 2 percent return might be good to junk mailers who use snail mail](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-rate-return-direct-mail-campaign-23974.html), but that’s not a scenario we want to emulate. Is such a low return worth it to be associated with junk mailers?  How do you feel about losing as much as 20% of possible users? Carousels can be accessibility hurdles. According the US Federal Government, [1 in 5 people have some sort of challenge to using the web](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html), you’re [actively obstructing some of your potential customers](https://www.sitepoint.com/unbearable-accessible-slideshow/).  On smart phones, carousels cause the most grief. They can cause touch confusion to the operating system. This means that [carousels cause frustration to the user](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-carousels/).  #### Alternative Solutions  Multiple online stores such as X and X have found that [it’s better to have a targeted or seasonal banner than a carousel](https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark). It  might be tempting to implement a carousel while your client is gathering data, but it’s better to use proven business strategies at first.  Brainstorm a value proposition banner or hero feature. An immediate, quickly-loaded statement of value creates an instant expectation. [Value proposition banners are better than carousels and are easier all-around to implement](https://conversionsciences.com/value-proposition-examples/).  Why not present a video of your best product or offering? A new website for a new company or organization will do well to introduce themselves or their offering in a stable, open, edge-to-edge piece of content such as a video. [Videos convert better than a lot of alternatives](https://neilpatel.com/blog/product-videos-conversion/).  #### Resources to Consider  Okay, I get it. Your client has their mind made up. Maybe even you have your mind made up. In this case, I have compiled some potential solutions for you. I can’t account for or even know about all the potential scenarios in the world. So, let me help you adapt. But first I’ll start with alternatives to carousels.  **Carousel Alternatives**  - Show the user your top-performing product or service. If you already have a winner among your offerings, promote it to the top, front, and center of your website. - Say something about any current sales or promotions. This hsow your organization to be active, current, and vibrant. - Use a hero layout to be proud of your organization’s value proposition. Do you fast turn-arounds? Say it!  - Feature a short video of your product or offering. Remember to let the user activate the video and give them controls to play or pause it.  **Carousels to Consider**  I am presenting these carousels as a reluctant approach if a carousel must be present. I have used them myself but I don’t want to suggest that they are the only options.  - Consider [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/), a light markup slider. - Look at [BxSlider](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)  #### Last Words  I don’t think a website should have a carousel. They seemed cool when they first slid onto the scene over ten years ago. But, I understand that sometimes personal preference will be victorious over reason. "

It doesn’t matter that these objects are thousands of years old. Form, texture, and material authenticity are some of the core considerations a designer should impress upon their client to imbue dignity across time and age to any created thing.

May iOS app makers are quickly following suit, including Google and Microsoft, designing and coding dark modes into their apps.  <figure>     <img class=""img-fluid"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/10/google_maps_dark_mode_night_1.jpg?w=2000&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1""          alt=""Hand holding a phone with Google Maps running.

For those of you who don’t know them, Nielson Normal Group (NN/G) are among the most respected user experience researchers in the computer technology industry.  Nielson Norman Group writes <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/"" title=""Dark Mode vs. Light Mode: Which Is Better?"" target=""_blank"">an article which presents their own analysis into whether dark mode is beneficial or not</a> for users. _They review academic literature on the subject as they haven’t done their own research._  #### The High Level Summary (tl;dr)  Which mode is better, light mode or dark mode? The answer depends on a few variables such as:  - User’s eye condition (not necessarily age) - Light levels in the user’s surroundings - Long-term versus short-term effects - Text size  **Light mode generally performed better** in all kinds of tests, from reading long form to glanceable tasks. Users in the research referenced by NN/G were able to complete tasks more quickly and accurately using light modes. Despite this, there are hints that light mode’s benefits could come at long term costs to eye health.  However, for users with some kind of myopia or other vision-related conditions like cataracts, **dark mode was better**. For these users, dark mode reduced overall fuzziness in the interfaces because less light was scattered by their eye conditions.  #### The Action  Give your users a choice. Let them choose between light mode or dark mode in your app. But, don’t enable dark mode by default, enable the light mode by default."

2020-03-04-color-contrast-text.md,"--- title: Make the Color Contrast Pop (enough) date: 2020-03-04 00:00:00 Z excerpt: Color is important because it can signal statuses, evoke emotion, and cause a purchase. But what if some people have trouble seeing your color? images: - image:     alt: Color Contrast example image.      url: https://isralduke-site-files.s3.amazonaws.com/images/color-contrast-banner.png ---  {{page.excerpt}}  #### What is Color Contrast  For our purposes in this article, Color Contrast refers to the amount of visual separation between two colors. For this article, I’ll be talking about the amount of Color Contrast between text and the background to the text. The amount of separation between those two colors can be measured with math.  Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to do any homework.  Each color you see on a screen, like a monitor or mobile phone screen, is encoded into the website or app using a numeric value which computers turn into the colors you see. White is encoded using the number `#FFFFFF` (called a hexadecimal value) and Black is encoded using the number `#000000`.   _Now, there are more number types we could use, such as `rgb(255,255,255,1)` for White and `rgb(0,0,0,1)` for Black (called RGB values), and there are more ways to encode color. But for this article we’ll only talk about the color numbers using <a href=""https://htmlcolorcodes.com"" target=""_blank"" title=""Make your own colors!"">hexadecimal values</a>._  #### Calculating Color Contrast  Now that I have those colors’ numbers, special tools called Contrast Calculators (here’s <a href=""https://colorific.darrellhanley.com"" target=""_blank"" title=""Color Contrast Calculator by Darrel Hanley"">my favorite Contrast Calculator</a> because it can also simulate color blindness) can perform calculations on those numbers to determine the amount of contrast (visual separation) between them. The resulting calculated number is called a Contrast Ratio.  Going back to White and Black, their Contrast Ratio is **21:1**. That’s the highest possible Contrast Ratio using current monitors and color technology. This is the best possible _color_ combination to make easily readable text on a screen. _(I’ll talk about text sizes in a later article.)_   #### How Much Color Contrast is Needed?  There’s a few different authorities we look to for guidance on how much Color Contrast we need to accommodate people with vision difficulties. One authority is <a href=""https://accessibility.digital.gov/visual-design/color-and-contrast/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Color Contrast Article on Digital dot gov"">Digital.gov’s Web Development and Design Standards</a>. Saying the simplest way, we need Color Contrast of **4.5:1** for the bare minimum. But, if we can design the website or app so that text gets Color Contrast of **7:1**, then we’re doing an exceptional job.  #### A Simple Breakdown  Again, talking only about color, the Color Contrast in text we want is:  - **4.5:1**. This is the minimum amount. - **7:1**. This is the awesome amount. - **3:1**. This is for a link in text to the surrounding text. - **3:1** This is the amount we want for the edges of user interface elements to the surrounding color.  #### The Takeway  **More Color Contrast is better.** Stay away from those light greys on whites! It may look cool to your graphic designer friends, it’s hard for some people to read. Older people, people with dimming vision, or people with other vision difficulties can more easily see text with higher Color Contrast. It follows that if people with difficulties can easily read your text, then people without vision difficulties will also be able to easily read your text."
