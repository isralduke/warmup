<p><strong>ZOMBIES!</strong>
</p>
<p>This book retells human events, from the early near east until the 21st century, using a zombie story arch to generate students’ in history. As the book’s motif is that of zombies acting as the catalysts accelerating the events of our shared timeline, it is important that the cover equates zombie activity to humanity’s global narratives.
</p>
<p>The background of the cover design is meant to evoke the material of scrolls and parchment, the early canvas for books before paper and the printing press. Evoking such early book materials signals the historic aspect of the book. The physical continents are colored like dried blood, with a rough texture. Continuing this horror concept is the two, conjoined zombie faces at the top, looking with hunger at the body of the earth in the tone of uninfected and infected humanity locked in step together, stumbling together across time.
