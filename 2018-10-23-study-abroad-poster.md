<p><a href="https://www.daad.org/en/" target="_blank" title="The DAAD homepage is your gateway to information about study, research and internships in Germany.">DAAD, an organization promoting international study in Germany</a> put out a call for poster design to promote study abroad in Germany for students in Canda and the United States.
</p>
<p>For two semesters I studied German language during my time as a graphic design student at Louisiana State University. So, when the opportunity to design a poster to promote study abroad in Germany to Canadian and United States students, I <em>sprang</em> into action! Sadly, <em>(I did not win the contest, but I earned an honorable mention so that wasn’t bad)</em>. German appealed to me because I loved early twentieth-century posters from Europe which I saw in art history classes, and the Bauhaus ideals appealed to me.
</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>A trip through München in 2017 revealed that I could still read enough German to glean the meanings of advertisements displayed in <em>der Zug</em>. If you’re a <em>Deutscher Volk</em>, please don’t hold it against me that I can’t converse gluently. I never really got the chances to use what I learned.
